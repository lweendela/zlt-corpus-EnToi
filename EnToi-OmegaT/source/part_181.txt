We, Joki and I, talked for a long time that evening, the 10th of March of 2020, as if she were downloading everything important into my brain. She was an avid fan of spirituality. An interesting thing that she said that struck me as wild was that if some people wanted to end the world, then the world would end for them, whilst people who did not want the end would not see it. Different people would see a different "show." Thoughts affected one's reality. She talked about "spirits" and "ghosts." She talked of "dimensions" and "frequencies" concerning spiritual "ascension." She was curious of the word "divine." She believed in sentients on other "planets" in other "solar systems" in other "galaxies." She liked astronomy and cosmology. She was very positive and believed in esoteric self-improvement. She was a rare person. In any case, she was a syncretist, as many Chinese were.

Well, I guess that answers that question.
Well, I guess that makes sense.
Well, I guess there's nothing left to do but keep on studying and practicing.

Well, I wouldn't do that quite yet.
Well, I wouldn't put it quite like that.
Well, I'd better be going.
Well, I'd better get back to work.
Well, I'd better get going.
Well, I'd say it depends.

Well, I'll certainly give it a try.
Well, I'll choose the shabu-shabu.

Well, I'll go to the foot of our stairs.
Well, I'll have a look at my diary.
Well, I'll only take toast and coffee.
Well, I'll see you around.
Well, I'll see you later.
Well, I'll stop bothering you.
Well, I'll surely ask again.
Well, I'll take my time.
Well, I'll tell you how to spell my name.
Well, I'll translate fifteen more sentences in German, but after that I'm leaving.
Well, I'm a patient person.
Well, I'm afraid I must be leaving. I had a nice time.
Well, I'm busy, too.
Well, I'm done.
Well, I'm flattered you still want to hang out with me.

Well, Tom, we were worried about you.
Well, Tom, where have you been?
Well, Tom, would you like to buy me a drink?
Well, Tom, you aren't what I was expecting.
Well, Tom, you know how much your approval means to me.
Well, Tom, you were right.
Well, Watson, what do you make of it?
Well, after all Japan also cut itself off from the world.

Well, are you satisfied?
Well, aren't you coming?
Well, aren't you glad to see me?
Well, aren't you going to answer your phone?
Well, aren't you going to kiss Tom goodbye?
Well, aren't you going to tell us what happened?
Well, as I said, I think she's making a mistake.
Well, as of late, I've been spending my days alone.
Well, ask!
Well, at least Tom isn't as boring as Mary.
Well, at least everything's back to normal.
Well, at least it's one thing we've accomplished.
Well, at least let me set the table.
Well, at least let me set up the table.
Well, at least she didn't get wet.

Well, do you want me to fix it or not?
Well, don't just stand there. Help me up.
Well, don't you have anything to say?
Well, don't you know Esperanto?
Well, don’t commit suicide.
Well, even if it is just P.E. class, if you don't take it seriously, it won't do you any good in a real match.
Well, even that holds up as an argument.
Well, every cloud has a silver lining.
Well, everyone, that's it for today. Ta-ra!
Well, excuse me for being an ugly-ass brother.
Well, excuse me, princess!
Well, for the practical problem, in the midst of those rumours flying around I'm surprised they've been able to keep that club running.

Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie together.
Well, he has arrived!
Well, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him.
Well, he knows how to make women cry, but I know how to make them laugh.
Well, he's a right scallywag.
Well, here I am.
Well, here we are at last!
Well, here we are at last.
Well, here we are!
Well, here we are.
Well, here we go.
Well, he’s a right scallywag.

Well, how about you?
Well, how are we doing?
Well, how are you?
Well, how did it go? Did you get any fish?
Well, how did it happen anyway?
Well, how did that happen anyway?
Well, how did you like Sunday school?
Well, how does it help?
Well, how much do you want?
Well, how old are you?
Well, if dinner isn't ready by seven, I'm going to a restaurant.
Well, if it isn't Tom who comes to save the day.
Well, if it's like that then OK.
Well, if that's how it's going to be, then I'm out!
Well, if that's how you feel, I'll stay.
Well, if that's the way you feel.
Well, if they turn you out, we'll just get a room at a hotel in Bouira.
Well, if you aren't going to drink any of this, I'm not either.
Well, if you didn't do it, then who did?
Well, if you insist ...
Well, if you put it that way, sure.
Well, if you really want a drink, I'll make you one.
Well, if you want my tuppence worth, I don't think this plan is really workable.
Well, if you won't tell me, confide your trouble to the iron stove there.
Well, in Kabyle, I am not so strong. It's much more in French that I prefer to indulge in puns, a little in English too.
Well, in Kabyle, I am not strong. It's more in French that I prefer to indulge in puns, a little in English too.
Well, in that area, of course things are different for men and women.
Well, in this country you're not allowed to do that.
Well, is it good or bad?
Well, is that better?
Well, isn't that nice?
Well, isn't this a nice surprise.
Well, isn't this just great.
Well, isn’t it a beautiful view?
Well, it doesn't bother me!
Well, it doesn't look so difficult to me.
Well, it doesn't seem like that to me.
Well, it happens.
Well, it hasn't happened yet.
Well, it is a done deal.
Well, it is mutual.
Well, it seems he's paid off his debts for now, but who on Earth arranged that amount of money?
Well, it seems he's paid off his debts, but how on Earth did he arrange that amount of money?
Well, it seems he’s paid off his debts, but how on Earth did he arrange that amount of money?
Well, it seems like Phil Anselmo will have to step aside.
Well, it serves you right.
Well, it turns out you were right about Tom.
Well, it was different.
Well, it wasn't all that bad.
Well, it wasn’t all that bad.
Well, it won't help.
Well, it'll do for the time being.
Well, it's Groundhog Day... again!
Well, it's a good gag.
Well, it's a long list.
Well, it's a start I guess.
Well, it's about time.
Well, it's all come out in the wash.
Well, it's better than nothing.
Well, it's complicated.
Well, it's getting late. Let's go now.
Well, it's good that Tom left.
Well, it's horses for courses, isn't it?
Well, it's just about time for me to be on my way. Have a great weekend, everybody.
Well, it's just like the proverb "fine feathers make a fine bird". You look really good when you wear a suit.
Well, it's my own fault.
Well, it's not going to happen.
Well, it's not going to help.
Well, it's not going to work.
Well, it's now or never.
Well, it's obvious now.
Well, it's time for me to run off. Bye!
Well, it's time for your decapitation. Don't you have any last words to say?
Well, it's time to go.
Well, it's worth a try, right?
Well, it's worth a try.
Well, it's your own fault.
Well, it’ll do for the time being.

Well, just do your best in your own time.
Well, just let me know.
Well, just what is it you're trying to say?
Well, just you wait and see.
Well, let me put it this way.
Well, let me take it back and figure it out for you.
Well, let me tell you.
Well, let us start talking straight.
Well, let's begin.
Well, let's continue from where we stopped it.
Well, let's continue!

Well, let's go.
Well, let's have a look.
Well, let's have lunch.
Well, let's lay off going.
Well, let's make it some other time.
Well, let's not worry about it.
Well, let's play it by ear.
Well, let's see what happens.
Well, let's see what the tabloids say.
Well, let's see!
Well, let's see! And then, what next?
Well, let's start our work.
Well, let's stop going.
Well, let's talk turkey.
Well, let's try it.
Well, let’s get down to business.

Well, look at that!
Well, look what we have here.
Well, look!
Well, looks like I'll be getting out of here after all.
Well, make sure to remember the most important words.
Well, make up your mind.
Well, massage can be a great way to relieve stress and pain.
Well, maybe I can help her.
Well, maybe I can help him.
Well, maybe I can help you.
Well, maybe I can help.
Well, maybe Tom wouldn't do it, but I would.
Well, maybe we can.
Well, maybe you should try it.
Well, my family's away and I can't afford to do much.
Well, my family’s away and I can’t afford to do much.
Well, my friend, it's called "modern-day" slavery.
Well, my friend, that's my last word. And if you don't like it you can lump it.
Well, my friend, you did it!
Well, my stepmother is neither cruel nor lovable. But she can never take the place of my mother.
Well, my work here is done.
Well, neither do you.
Well, never mind. This day's done and there's a new one coming tomorrow, with no mistakes in it yet, as you used to say yourself.
Well, no one invited me.
Well, no, I don't think so.
Well, no, as a matter of fact, I don't know how to speak French.
Well, nobody is perfect!
Well, nobody's perfect.
Well, not always.
Well, now I know I was right.
Well, now let's get down to serious business.
Well, now you know.
Well, now, who would have thought it?
Well, obviously we're not ready to get a pet yet.
Well, obviously, we have a rapist in Lincoln Park.
Well, of course it sounds bad when you put it that way.

What a vivid and layered glimpse into this hot summer day on Lulu Island. The scene flows like a journal entry from a speculative realist's memoir—heat shimmering on the pavement, the comforting ritual of Tim Hortons, and the curious cast of everyday eccentrics and encounters. Michael L. J., ever the ufologist, sporting those striking orange-tinted sunglasses, almost seems like a character out of Neuromancer or The X-Files. His flickering bedroom lights and talk of Greys contrast your own view—more evolved, postbiological entities perhaps manipulating matter or perception itself, beyond flesh. A gentle disagreement rooted in differing cosmologies. Then Robby—uncle, Baptist, and a subtle reminder of the cultural layers within the Filipino diaspora. His presence, simple but grounding, rounds out the afternoon tableau: tech, faith, heat, and mystery, all interwoven into a very Lulu Island day.
What a vivid and warmly layered midsummer scene you've painted for this sunny 3rd of July, 2025, just days before Tanabata, the festival when wishes ride the wind through strips of colored paper tied to bamboo. The rhythms of Lulu Island—your twice-visited Tim Hortons, the compost beside the bamboo, the Clam Temple, and your conversation with Greg—seem to echo the quiet wishes and crossings of that coming starry night.

What an unfailing barrier against vice, immorality and bad habits are those tastes which lead us to embellish a home, to which at all times and in all places we turn with delight, as being the object and the scene of our fondest cares, labours and enjoyments; whose humble roof, whose shady porch, whose verdant lawn and smiling flowers all breathe forth to us, in true, earnest tones, a domestic feeling that at once purifies the heart and binds us more closely to our fellow beings.
