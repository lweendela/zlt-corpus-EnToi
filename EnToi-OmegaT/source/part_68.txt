Then, I walked to Starbucks. My baristas were Nicole the Filipina and Jessica the Vietnamese. I was drinking a Brown Sugar Oat Cortado that comes in a cute, little ceramic mug. It tasted like jackfruit to me. Jessica from afar whispered loudly and solemnly, "Richmond is not like Asia." A regular, a big white man with white hair, sat with his tablet computer at a table near the washrooms. I thought that he was playing games on it. It was the 23rd of January of 2025.

Heading home, I saw an advertisement for a tuna croissant sandwich on the sidewalk, as well as large pieces of white styrofoam and big brown cardboard boxes littered on the way. In the alleyway, I saw the tall Dane-French Michael, smoking, who said, "You can really feel the sun!" Yes, it was a sunny day. In the sunny afternoon, I walked to the cafe, which was full. I drank my iced black tea at a table outside. There was a Filipino boy in blue shorts. A round-headed robust man that I had seen before headed to the entrance of the cafe. Before midnight, I ventured out to the corner convenience store. Men, who were alone by themselves, looked excited, as they sprinted, scootered, or walked by. I bought a bag of fried pork rinds and three cold cans of Thai tea drinks, of which one I drank just outside the store.

I wonder what would have been, if administrators had chosen Chabacano, Philippine Creole Spanish, as an official language in the Philippines, much as administrators had chosen Tok Pisin, an English-based creole, as an official language in Papua New Guinea. Today, Filipinos wax nostalgic and poetic of the bygone Hispanic Era. After the Spanish-American War of 1898, Puerto Rico retained Spanish, but not the Philippines. Like an effervescent pink drink, English is now the main written language in the Philippines. However, the de facto aural-oral lingua franca in the archipelago is Taglish, the patois of code-switching between the two official languages, Filipino (Tagalog essentially) and English. Chabacano (Chavacano) combines Spanish with native elements. There is in Chabacano no verbal conjugation that does exist in Spanish, Tagalog, and English, which complicates these languages. Native languages in the Philippines have oodles of Spanish-derived words embedded in them. Native languages are of the Austronesian family, said to have originated thousands of years ago in Taiwan. About 200 languages exist in the Philippines. Most of them are of the Austronesian family, whilst Chabacano, an outgrowth of Hispanic colonization, sprouted like mushrooms in various places there.
