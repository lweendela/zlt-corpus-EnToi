That's it for today. We'll see you next time.
That's it for your medical exam.
That's it in a nutshell.

That's just a quirk of his.
That's just a rough calculation.
That's just a rumor, I'm pretty sure.
That's just a rumor.
That's just a rumour.
That's just a shot in the dark. How do you think you'll succeed by just acting on the spur of the moment like that?
That's just a start.
That's just a waste of taxpayer money.
That's just a wig!
That's just a yarn.
That's just about it.

That's just an accusation.
That's just an advertising trick.
That's just an estimate.
That's just an excuse!
That's just an excuse.

That's just my guess.
That's just my imagination.
That's just my opinion.
That's just my personal opinion.
That's just my two cents.
That's just my way of saying things, dude. It always puzzles me that non-native speakers think they can decide if shit sounds natural or weird unless, of course, it has evident grammatical errors or the wording is fucked up.
That's just nasty.
That's just no fun.
That's just nonsense.
That's just not acceptable.
That's just not cool.

That's just not enough.
That's just not going to happen today.
That's just not going to happen.
That's just not my thing.
That's just not possible.
That's just not right.
That's just not the case.
That's just not the right way to do that.
That's just not true.
That's just not very good.
That's just one example.
That's just one of our many problems.

That's just plain wrong.
That's just replacement theology.
That's just rude.
That's just sad.
That's just sick.
That's just silly, don't you think?
That's just silly.
That's just so sad.
That's just something my family does.
That's just speculation.
That's just standard practise, it's not like they're cutting corners.

That's just typical.
That's just useless.
That's just weird.
That's just what I hope to do.
That's just what I need right now.
That's just what I need.
That's just what I needed.
That's just what I said!

That's kind of far from Europe, don't you think?
That's kind of gross.
That's kind of important.
That's kind of nice.
That's kind of rare.
That's kind of rude.
That's kind of sad.
That's kind of the point.
That's kind of vague.
That's kind of weird.
That's kind of what I expected.
That's kind of you to say.
That's kind of you, Lisa.
That's kind of you, Tom.
That's kinda scary to think about.
That's kooky.
That's lame.
That's last year's snow.
That's less interesting than I thought it would be.
That's lesson number one.
That's life!
That's life's curse.
That's life, unfortunately!
That's life.
That's like a kick in the nuts.

That's like looking under girls' skirts.
That's like putting a golden nose ring in a pig's nose.
That's like selling coals to Newcastle.

That's likely a new record.
That's likely not true.
That's likely to be a problem.
That's likely to be incorrect.
That's likely to be wrong.
That's likely to happen.
That's likely true.
That's likely what caused the problem.
That's likely why we never found it.

The African National Congress registers its firm rejection of the United States government's decision to grant refugee status to 49 individuals self-identifying as Afrikaners. Let it be categorically stated: there are no Afrikaner refugees in South Africa. No section of our society is hounded, persecuted or subject to ethnic victimisation. These claims are a fabrication and a cowardly political construct designed to delegitimise our democracy and insult the sacrifices made by generations who fought for freedom. This year, as we commemorate the 70th Anniversary of the Freedom Charter, we recall its enduring truth that "South Africa belongs to all who live in it, black and white." This is further enshrined in our Constitution, which affirms equality, dignity and non-racialism as the bedrock of our national life. What the instigators of this falsehood seek is not safety, but impunity from transformation. They flee not from persecution, but from justice, equality and accountability for historic privilege. The misuse of refugee protections to shield right-wing, anti-transformation elements is a violation of the spirit and letter of international law. Millions around the world face real persecution and they are the ones deserving of sanctuary, not those offended by a democratic society working to redress past injustice.
