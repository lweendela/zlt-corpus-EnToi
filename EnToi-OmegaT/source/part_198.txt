You're the light of my life.
You're the love of my life, Melissa.
You're the love of my life, and I can't bear the thought of losing you.
You're the love of my life, and you will be forever.
You're the love of my life.
You're the love of my life. I don't have eyes for any other woman.
You're the lucky one.
You're the magnet, and I'm the metal.
You're the man I've been looking for.
You're the man of my life and I want to make you happy always.
You're the man!
You're the man.
You're the manager, not me.
You're the married one.
You're the master of your own destiny.
You're the master.
You're the mayor's daughter, aren't you?
You're the missing puzzle piece I've been trying to find.
