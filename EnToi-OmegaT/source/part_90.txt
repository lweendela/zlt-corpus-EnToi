Like Christianity and Judaism, Islam is a so-called Abrahamic religion. Muslims, as Islamic people are called, repudiate Christianity's Trinity which alludes to polytheism. Islam is strictly monotheistic as they believe that there is only One God, Allāh. Their sacred writings are in the Qur'an, divided into 114 suras, containing 6236 āyāt, verses. Muslims believe that the Qur'an is only perfect in the original Arabic because any translation would be deficient. Their main prophet is Muhammad, the messenger. Muslim eschatology includes bodily resurrection at the Day of Resurrection, Yawm al-Qiyāmah, when everyone will be judged for good or bad deeds. Trials and tribulation precede and coincide with al-Qiyāmah, the time of which no human knows. (I read somewhere too that in Islam, being in hell may be an impermanent condition.) Like other Abrahamicists, Muslims believe in angels. Muslims believe in predestination or divine preordainment. Muslims must pray 5 times during the day. The prayer rituals are called Ṣalāh. Like other religions, Islam has subdivisions, as the Sunni and Shia, the contention being the successor, Abu Bakr or Ali respectively, to Muhammad. (The Islamic religion's progression and overall ambiance are depicted in Frank Herbert's Dune series, which is set thousands of years from now in outer space. There is a desert planet called Arrakis.)
Like Earth, Mars has both northern and southern polar ice caps.

Lojban and its predecessor Loglan are mutually unintelligible.
Lojban can sound ridiculous, but it can be very sophisticated.
Lojban doesn't just have elements of Mandarin in it. And Japanese has elements of different Chinese topolects.
Lojban has a whole repertoire of particle words that express emotions. This idea is from Lojban's mother Láadan. In Lojban, "au" means desire and "ai" means intent. There are many others. Vling is much simpler. An exclamatory sentence ends with "mak1" for strong emotion or with "lei1" for soft emotion. A command ends with "au1" and a polite request ends with "ei1" simply. The numeral "1" indicates a low level tone. Vling tries to be simple.
Lojban has incorporated a detailed grammar for mathematical expressions. This grammar parallels the predicate grammar of the non-mathematical language.
Lojban has shorter contractions for basic roots in compounding, reminiscent of "kun" and "on" readings of sinograms in Japanese.
Lojban has six vowels, /a e i o u ə/ written <a e i o u y>. The last vowel is all you need for the "marshmallow effect."
Lojban has the word "pinji," which means "penis" or "clitoris."
Lojban is a difficult language, right?
Lojban is alive only because problems in it continue to exist.
Lojban is cute.
Lojban is designed to be unambiguous in orthography, phonology, morphology, and grammar. Lojban semantics, however, must support the same breadth of human thought as natural languages.
