Fari yelled at the top of his lungs. "My... PMSing as usual, I see," the King continued to mutter dejectedly. "Shit, I'm so fucking bored. Nothing good on TV. Nothing good online. Nothing good to eat." As he was about to leave the dining hall, his eyes were drawn to a cinnamon jar standing lonely on the table. A spoon of cinnamon was placed conveniently next to it. In a saner state the King may have been reasonably suspicious about it, but now he was so exhausted from boredom that any opportunity to relieve it for a minute felt like a blessing. "I wonder what ground cinnamon tastes like," said he nonchalantly and put the spoon in his mouth.

Today is the 14th of January of 2025. It was night at Time Hortons café. I ate Sea Salt Potato Wedges with Wildberry Hibiscus Lemonade Quencher. Joban the South Asian was my vendor. In the morning, I had a couple or more cups of Green Tea with Oat Milk, which, someone expressed, "tastes like ice cream." It was night at Starbucks café. I ate two Belgian Liège Waffles. The Brown Sugar Oat Cortado interestingly tasted like jackfruit. I was going to tell the Japanese-Anglo hybrid Chris the barista or Jess the Anglo barista. Money is just an inhibitor, sometimes. Money is poverty, sometimes. Life should always be sensual, a sensory wonderland. Life is ephemeral, full of fleeting experiences. Do I believe in the Akashic Records, the memory compendium about everything? The following day of the 15th, I saw Hans the Netherlander in his motorized wheelchair at Tim Hortons. We sat near the sun-drenched bay window, as we chatted and ate Sea Salt Potato Wedges. I was drinking Orange Pekoe tea with Oat Milk for a change.

Today is the 9th of July of 2025, a bit of a wet day for summer. At Tim Hortons café, I partied by myself by eating two Supreme Stack sandwiches at different times, an extravagant expense for me. I drank two Iced Coffees with oat milk and an Iced Classic Lemonade. I didn't have a Fruit Explosion Muffin. I saw Lyle the white man sitting at a different corner. On the 7th, I went to the "Clam Temple," the Roman Catholic church on St. Albans Road, for the 66th time this year. On the 6th, I met Timur the Kazakh, waiting for his "fiery Persian" girlfriend at Tim Hortons café. The first time that I saw him, I enquired: "Are you Japanese? Filipino? Chinese? Korean? I couldn't guess..." as he denied the sequence of guesses. He was "Kazakh," like my pizza delivery man friend Adil from years ago at Pizza Hut. Timur is a handsome man, part-Russian and speaks Russian, Kazakh, and heavily accented English. He was wearing green camouflage army shorts. We talked about a lot of things, including his interest in video games and the auxlang Interslavic.

Today marks the most deadly shooting in American history. The shooter was apparently armed with a handgun and a powerful assault rifle. This massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school, or in a house of worship, or a movie theater, or in a nightclub. And we have to decide if that’s the kind of country we want to be. And to actively do nothing is a decision as well.

Today on the 12th of January of 2022, at the cafe, I had a glass of black iced tea. Upon exiting, I greeted Hans the Netherlander on a wheelchair a happy new year. We briefly discussed about the ongoing deployment of the James Webb Space Telescope to the Sun-Earth L2 Langrange point. The worry at the moment is about micrometeorites. Incidentally, Hans mentioned a Scottish friend Tom who took a lethal injection yesterday at his hospice because he had cancer.
Today on the 14th of April of 2015, is an appointment at the doctor's. In the late morning, on my way, I stop at the Roman Catholic worship centre, a mid-20th-century brown building. A bell rings as it is the end of recess for the noisy children at the adjacent school. It is practically empty in the spacious interior of the worship centre, except for a middle-aged, dark-haired Caucasian woman by the candles and an Oriental who looks like George Takei and who passes me by as he heads out. I sit at the pew, centre right. The banners above are in faded pastels, blue, pink, yellow, and green, with three butterflies printed on them each. A month ago, the banners were all purple. The statue of floating JC, front centre, is adorned in white and yellow cloth. The standing cross to the right is covered with green paper bits. I stand up and walk to the lobby area. Therein, I marvel at the Mexican Santa María painting and whisper the Spanish words on the caption. I gaze at the elegant photographs of Pope Francis and some other high-level religious authority figure. As I exit the building, a Filipino woman approaches the statue of white and blue Virgin Mary at the outside corner.

Today the 21st of August of 2022, my neighbour Moli Wong, who is of mixed Chinese and East Indian ancestry from a previously Fijian nationality, now on Lulu Island, gave me, for dinner, roti with green beans and eggs inside. It's East Indian cuisine. She's thinking about what I said to my mother yesterday: Mexican and East Indian cuisines created similar foods in independent, parallel development. Somewhat related is my thinking that things living and non-living in other worlds may have parallel evolution, also. There may be life human-like, bird-like, horse-like, tree-like, grass-like, etc. on other worlds from parallel evolution. Another theory relevant is panspermia, in which biological bits seed other worlds from outer space.
Today the 6th of August of 2023 has been a fabulous day here on Lulu Island to do with my Fijian neighbours, the Wongs, who are partly Chinese and partly East Indian. Moli the grandma has given us about a dozen green figs from her backyard trees. (Incidentally, her name means "orange" in Fijian.) In return, Mama has me give them Swiss chard and three green poblanos, grown by my elder brother Fernando in Vancouver. Moli has given us her exotic cooking. In Moli's kitchen, her husband Leong and she are watching a Sunday church television show. I know that the Wongs are Catholic, but the show is not. In the corner of Moli's kitchen is fully decorated with Fijian masks, etc., which intrigue me, being an art collector myself. I talk with her grownup kids Sandra and Isaac. The Wongs resemble Japanese to me. Sandra and Isaac will be visiting Western Europe in September. Sandra and Moli have previously been to Greece. I recount my experience there with amazing whitewashed buildings with blue roofs. I say to them that some Japanese fantasize to live in a Mediterranean village. I say that some of my Greek-Jew ancestors from Greece settled in Panama, so I have relatives there today. My great-grandfather instead went to the Philippines. Sandra has visited Costa Rica. We agree that tourists should not be so "snooty" and should learn some of the local lingo. Such makes friendlier relations. I go home to make "horchata de arroz" or rice drink mix from El Salvador, given by my elder brother.

Today was also the first day the scientists were able to get in the water. This is my first cruise to the monument and I was beyond excited to hear I would get a few hours to snorkel the maritime archeologist’s field sites. The archeology team and I were launched from one of the Hi’ialakai’s small boats and were soon hovering over a wreck that is thought to be an American whaling ship. It was particularly intriguing as a marine mammal scientist to be able to see large pots used to render oil from the whales, blubber hooks, and other whaling paraphernalia scattered along the reef. Marine mammals played such an important role in the human history of these islands, it is exciting to be able to return to these sites as a scientist and simultaneously learn about whales’ past and present influence on this area.

Today's a cloudy, yet sunny day, the 13th of May of 2025. Yesterday and today, I went to the garden neighbourhood at St. Albans Road to enjoy the scenery and the big Roman Catholic church there, which I have visited maybe the 11th time this spring. The big admirable purple-bloom tree nearby is probably not a Jacaranda, but maybe a Paulownia, an Empress Tree. Nevertheless, it's like saudade for me about South America. I often visit the major worship hall and the smaller Adoration Chapel, where I noticed that at the right front the statue of the Virgin Mary is holding the Child at her arms, and they are not standing side by side, as I imagined from memory. At the big worship hall, there are two crucifixes, one at the front centre and one at the front right, both draped in white cloth. There are Filipinos in the parish. By the way, it's now Pope Leo XIV. I'm really tending to Animism-Buddhism in my Syncretism. I visited Tim Hortons café here on Lulu Island several times during the day to enjoy an Earl Grey Tea with oat milk, an Iced Classic Lemonade, Scrambled Eggs with Sausage and Potatoes, an Iced Coffee with oat milk, and a Wild Blueberry Muffin. Today, at home, I'm reading bits from Spanish speculative fiction, El eterno regreso a casa, by Ursula K. Le Guin. I read aloud for oral practice. I'm also looking at an online Esperanto dictionary to ameliorate my green vocabulary.
Today's a good day for a picnic.
Today's a new day!
Today's a rainy cooler spring day, the 16th of May of 2025. The last couple of days have been grey weather. Yesterday, at Tim Hortons café, I ate my first Chili from there. Michael L. J., my Dane-French ufologist friend, visited there. We looked at his videos on his cellphone, about bedroom light activities that he attributes to extraterrestrials. I don't mention the Zoo Hypothesis to him. He believes in the Grey Aliens or other humanoid outworlders. (I opine that outworlders may not necessarily be humanoids.) Michael and I also talked about our different snorkelling experiences in Mexico. I recounted to him about the temples at Tulum, on a cliff, overlooking a white beach and surrounded by jungle. I said that it looked "like a set in Star Trek." Michael said that he only saw it from far away. Today, anyway, I also went to Tim Hortons café, of which the highlight was my Lemon Poppyseed Muffin and later a Fruit Explosion Muffin. I had a Vanilla Oat Milk Cold Brew. I would try their Chili again, another time. I visited the fruteria Kin's Farm Market, where I bought Vietnamese Red Jackfruit the other day. I hesitated to buy big white mushrooms today.

Today's the 2nd of May of 2025. It was so sunny warm today that I could wear my fishing safari mesh travel vest outside. As usual, I went to Tim Hortons café, several times: some teas with oat milk, a sausage English muffin, and a Lemon Poppyseed Muffin. I ventured to St. Albans Road. The cherry blossom trees have mainly shed their petals already. I trudged all the way to the Roman Catholic church, there to first time visit the tranquil Adoration Chapel. In my neighbourhood, I took selfies near wisteria vines—violet blooms ablaze. At the café was a memorable sight of an Araboid man with great tattoos on his muscular left arm. My religion is really Syncretic, tending towards Buddhist-Animist.
Today's the 9th of May of 2025. All day has been grey skies. After morning Iced Coffee with oat milk at Tim Hortons café, I went walking towards the Roman Catholic church on St. Albans Road, just so I could pass by the big tree that looks like a jacaranda tree with purple blooms, but isn't a jacaranda. (The species remind me of South America.) More of the brick-like impressions on the pedestrian have been painted white, not red as I would imagine. Lulu Islanders aren't so fanciful with colours, unlike Vancouver or other cities. I went to the major worship hall, again to admire the fancy colourful stained glass. The crucifix is adorned with white fabric. At the smaller Adoration Chapel, I began to notice on the right front the Virgin Mary statue with the Child statue on her side. In the evening, I returned to the café to enjoy a Green Tea with oat milk, a Blackberry Yuzu Lemonade Quencher, and a Roast Beef Craveable Sandwich. At home, I amused myself with Korean grammar, which was a slight distraction to my core studies of Esperanto and Lojban. With StreetView, I started looking again at the streets in South Korea. Maybe, I will try more of the countryside, as I have done with Thailand. For lunch and dinner at home was noodle dishes.

Today, the 18th of February of 2025, I ate two sandwiches on separate walking trips to Tim Hortons café: In the late morning, I ate a Roast Beef Craveable sandwich, then in the afternoon, a Crispy Chicken Craveable sandwich. It was a grey-clad sky. I usually have a small Earl Grey tea with oat milk. At home, as a break from my studies of Chabacano, Philippine Creole Spanish, I read for practice some stories aloud in "real" Spanish, of speculative fiction. Spanish has lots of available literature. Meanwhile, Chabacano itself needs more written literature, I opine: On the Web, all I could find that were substantial models were religious magazines from Jehovah's Witnesses, even though my spiritual inclination is towards Science, Buddhism, and Animism. Oh, well! The next day, I would discover that Grok AI could write stories in Chabacano! The AI would manufacture stories about Jack and the Beanstalk, and as well as about Count Dracula and his red horse carriage, all in Chabacano.
Today, the 18th of February of 2025, I go walking to Tim Hortons several times during the grey-sky day. I drink White Chocolate Pistachio Oat Milk Latte, cold, twice. Yesterday was the first time that I drank it. Yesterday was a day with Latinos: In the afternoon, there was a handsome round-faced mestizo: Caucasoid and Amerindian. He reminded me of myself, like a mirror image. He seemed to interest himself in Chabacano, Philippine Creole Spanish. He was fiddling with his smartphone. We smiled at each other without talking, as if he did not want to speak English with me. Last night, there was a younger Latino with a Latina, talking at a table next to mine. The man mentioned an Esperanto word, "Nikaragvo" (Nicaragua), to which I obliquely replied with "Gvatemalo" (Guatemala). I sensed that he interested himself in Esperanto and Lojban, from the way he was talking to the woman.
