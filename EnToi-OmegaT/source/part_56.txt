I kowtowed.
I label Rod, a bicyclist at the Lulu Island café, a spiritual "eclectic," this morning on the 22nd of August of 2022. He is a slim older white man. He talks to me, whilst I munch on salted vinegar potato chips with iced black tea, beside a favourite Spanish-language sci-fi book, Crónicas de Majipur, by Robert Silverberg. Rod believes that there is "one God," but I say that God could be either singular or plural, as number is a limitation on God. I wonder if he is a "pantheist" or "panpsychist," who believes that there is, at some level, the divine or the mind, respectively, in everybody and everything, even a "pillow." The terminology excites him. He shows me a video describing the complex Aztec calendar on his smartphone. The presentation is full of Aztec, aka Nahuatl, words, which he mistakes for "Mayan." I tell him that in ancient Mexico, the Aztecs were more like the Japanese, whilst the Maya were more like the Chinese. I utter some words presented in Nahuatl. He does not look too surprised that I know how to pronounce. We both have visited Mexico before.
