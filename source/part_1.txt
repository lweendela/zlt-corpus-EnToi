"Not anymore."

"And what did you say?" "I said I didn't know."
"He asked me the name of Mary's father." 
"And what did you say?" "I said I didn't know."
"He became a Muslim." 
"But did he stay a Muslim?"

"He bent over and put his forehead to the ground." 
"He's a Muslim and he was praying."
"He called me neoclassical," sobbed Mary.

"He had been 30 years, or whatever it was, plowing a lonely furrow and finding that, actually, what he was being confronted with were the small compromises — looking the other way, the small corruptions — and that he didn't get the test he wanted to get, so he had become quite disillusioned and quite aggressive," explains Gleeson.
"He had this reputation for being abrasive, punk,'' said Ettedgui. "But what we see in the archive is McQueen with friends, with his parents, even his beloved dogs, being very human and very tender at times.''
"He has so much money that he doesn't know how to spend it." 
"I wish I was in such a situation... I would know how to spend it."
"He has to be taken to the hospital? But what is it?" "It's a big building with patients, but that's not important right now."
"He hit me." 
"Turn the other cheek."
"He holds huge rocks; these, Eurus, are for thee, / there let him glory in his hall and reign, / but keep his winds close prisoners."
"He is a bit conservative"..."You mean to say stuck up?"
"He is an advanced jerk," said Mary, throwing her phone into her purse.
"He is dead and gone," she said to the sparrows. "We don't believe it," they replied.

"He is Muslim."

"He said he'll be here in an hour." 
"He was talking Algerian time." 
"My goodness."
"He said that there were no traces upon the ground round the body. He did not observe any. But I did—some little distance off, but fresh and clear.” “Footprints?” “Footprints.” “A man’s or a woman’s?” Dr. Mortimer looked strangely at us for an instant, and his voice sank almost to a whisper as he answered:— “Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound!”
"He says he's an introvert." 
"Yeah right! There's no way that guy's an introvert!" "I was thinking the same thing."
"He seemed like he was kind of flirting with you." 
"You think?"
"He seems a very amiable person," said Holmes, laughing. "I am not quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own."
"He should win an Oscar for that." 
"Emmy. It's a TV show."
"He speaks Berber." 
"Yes, that's Berber."
"He told me that he loved me." 
"He told me the same thing!"
"He told me that he misses me." 
"I wish he would tell me that, too."
"He used to love me," she answered sadly.
"He wants you particklar; no one else'll do, as the Devil's private secretary said ven he fetched avay Doctor Faustus," replied Mr. Weller.
"He wants you specifically; no one else will do, as the Devil's private secretary said when he took Doctor Faustus away," replied Mr. Weller.
"He was Kabyle." 
"Yes, but only on his father's side."
"He went jogging." 
"In this weather?"
"He went out to see a movie." 
"How was the movie?" "Good."
"He who does not feel cannot know," said St. Augustine.
"He who manages to reestablish my crown receives a reward" said the king. "He receives my daughter, the princess, as his wife."
"He who thinks is. The contrapositive thereof is: he who is not does not think. But does the converse of this hold as well: that he who does not think is not?" "That rock over there does not think, and yet it is."
"He won an Oscar." 
"You've got to be kidding."
"He" and "she" don't sound Japanese, so I feel guilty every time I use them.
"He'd be more interested in me if I looked like Mary." 
"That's not true."
"He'd like to have a coffee after work." 
"I would too."
"He's Algerian, isn't he?" "What difference does it make?"
"He's Muslim." 
"Is this an issue?"
"He's a drug addicted, corrupt politician." 
"Then, he's one of the many."
"He's a poor and honest man." 
"That's why he's a poor man."
"He's a she, not a he." 
"What do you mean?" "That person is transgender."
"He's a thug." 
"Don't call him that."
"He's a tiger when he's angry" is an example of metaphor.
"He's angry." 
"I can't say you're wrong."
"He's been sick." 
"Oh really, I hope it's nothing serious."
"He's black." 
"Is this an issue?"
"He's dead." 
"No, he's not."
"He's going to eat an apple!" No sooner had Mary uttered these words and pointed at Tom, who was already posing theatrically with the fruit held out to himself as if it were Yorick's skull, than the room all at once fell silent. Everyone was looking on, mesmerised, not daring to breathe. Tom had never before even touched an apple: no one had ever managed to make the fruit seem palatable to him, or even managed to get one within a few metres of him. But now, to prove his love to Mary, Tom had taken the apple, as Adam had from Eve's hand, and the last remaining moments of his life of virtue were slipping away.
"He's going to faint." 
"He's faking."
"He's livened up since you arrived." 
"No he hasn't, has he?" "Oh, he has. He's got that twinkle in his eye again." 
"It's a nervous tic." 
"Hah, no. It's you, definitely."
"He's married." 
"What does it matter."
"He's one of my best men." 
"If you say so."
"He's richer than my uncle." 
"But your uncle isn't rich at all."
"He's rude." 
"I can live with that."
"He's single." 
"Who's single?"
"He's still living in Tunisia." 
"Algeria." 
"Whatever."
"Hear me!" cried the Ghost. "My time is nearly gone."
"Hear that? What a spellbinding voice! Where's it coming from?" "It's coming from the meadow over there."
"Heart" and "choir" have the same pronunciation.
"Heaven preserve us!" cried the young ladies; and they hastily put the fire out.
"Hee hee," his mother chuckled, shaking her head.
"Heel!" is one of the commands his dog responds to.
"Heel" is one of the commands his dog obeys.
"Hello Every" is really grammatically correct, logically because of a crazy rule of an expression source.
"Hello Mary! Did I wake you?" "It's two in the morning. Why don't you try ringing a bit earlier for once?" "I did, after tea, but as ever you weren't there."

"Oh. I see. I'll apologize to him later, then."
"Hey, uh, so yesterday, I ate the chocolate Tom had in the fridge, and he got really mad at me. Don't you think his reaction was a bit much?" "By the chocolate in the fridge, do you mean the one that was in that pink box?" "Yeah."

"Oh my! And after being so deeply in love!"

"No, it's most likely happening."

"I'm going to be so cool!" "Now, Link," Impa was about to barge in, but the King brushed her off quickly, "Hell no, don't start that shit with us, Impa." 
"I just wanted to tell Link about when I went to school," she retorted. The King laughed heartily. "Oh yes, it must have been great having Jesus as your chemistry partner!" "Well I never!" "Take her away!" yelled the King to Fari angrily.
"Hi," Tom said shyly.

"I can shave without looking in a mirror!" "That's good, but do not stand over my Persian carpet. You're bloody!"
"I can sing," said Tom.
"I can speak a bit of German. 'Das ist fantastisch!'" "Haha, wunderbar." 
"Wunderbar." 
"Even the locals sound better when they speak German, okay?" "Haha, is nobody gonna get my accent?" "No, not really, 'cause, you know..." 
"To be honest, I only learned my German from watching DVDs when I was younger." 
"Hahaha, be sure to send me those DVDs!"

"And they said he couldn't throw a baseball."
"I can't believe how easy it is to make chicken parmesan," said Matthew's friend after trying his recipe.
"I can't believe it," he kept saying under his breath.
"I can't believe it." 
"Believe it!"
"I can't believe that they sleep together!" "Why not? It's perfectly normal to take a teddy bear to bed with you."
"I can't believe that you snuck into the castle!" said the princess.
"I can't believe they're keeping us in the dark about our destination." 
"Yeah, they love keeping us on our toes. Could be anywhere, man."
"I can't believe they're sleeping together." 
"Why? It's completely normal to take your teddy bear to bed!"
"I can't believe this camera still works." 
"How old is it?" "40 years old." 
"That's why it still works."
"I can't believe this." 
"You can't believe what?"
"I can't believe what you say, because I see what you do."
"I can't believe you've never tried chicken parmesan before," Matthew exclaimed to his friend.
"I can't delete the file." 
"How about now?"
"I can't deny it anymore. I'm in love with you." 
"Oh, the relief! I've been longing to tell you I love you too."
"I can't do everything you've asked me to do." 
"Then just do what you can."
"I can't do it on Saturday." 
"How come? You promised."
"I can't do that." 
"Neither can I."
"I can't do that." 
"Nor anyone else, apparently."
"I can't do that." 
"Nor can anyone else, apparently."
"I can't do this for you." 
"Come on, how often do I ask you for anything?"
"I can't eat. I have butterflies in my stomach", said Mary. "Ugh, I can't eat either. I have a grilled chicken in my stomach", complained Tom.
"I can't even fold one more crane," she said to herself.
"I can't even make a crane," she said to herself.
"I can't figure this out." 
"That makes two of us."
"I can't find Tom." 
"Try phoning him."
"I can't find Tom." 
"Try ringing him."
"I can't fold another crane," she said to herself.
"I can't get enough of these biscuits. Did you make them yourself?" "Yes, following my grandmother's recipe."
"I can't get that song out of my head." 
"Which one?"
"I can't give a talk about economics. I don't know anything about it." 
"That's never stopped you before."
"I can't go dancing with you." 
"Bummer."
"I can't go through the Haunted Wood," cried Anne desperately.
"I can't hear you! The wind is buffeting my ears!" "What?"
"I can't help feeling that Tom's angry with me." 
"Oh, rubbish! Why would he be angry with you? He loves you more than anything."
"I can't help it," she said, "I'm already in love with him."
"I can't hold it!" "We're almost there. Just sit as still as you can and take deep breaths."
"I can't just lie to her." 
"Why not?"
"I can't just lie to him." 
"Why not?"
"I can't keep it to myself any longer. I love you." 
"I've been waiting for you to say that. I love you too."
"I can't on Saturday." 
"How come? You promised."

"I can't see Tom." 
"He's over there."
"I can't sleep." 
"Me neither."

"I can't swim." 
"Neither can I."
"I can't tell my girlfriend that I'm in jail." 
"But she will find out anyway."
"I can't tell you that." 
"Why?" "Because it's secret." 
"Secret? For me?"
"I can't think of the word for it." 
"Can you describe it?"
"I can't think of the word for it." 
"How would you say it in French?"
"I can't think with that noise," she said, as she stared at the typewriter.
"I can't think with that noise," she said, staring at the typewriter.
"I can't wait to be a grown-up." 
"Why?" "Because when I grow up I won't have to study anymore."
"I can't wait to see the King talk!" "You saw him talk at breakfast this morning." 
"I sure did."
"I can't wear that." 
"Why not? It looks great on you."
"I can't, but I'm supposed to!" - "You have to!" - "I'm not allowed to!"
"I cannot claw my owner", said the cat.
"I cannot go with you," she said very quietly.

"That’s too bad."
"I certainly hope so." replied Tom.
"I changed my hair." 
"Why?"
"I changed your life." 
"You have no idea."
"I choose you." 
"Why me?"
"I collect stamps." 
"Are you a philatelist?" "A philatelist? What's that?"
"I confess," said I, "that I do not quite follow you." 
"I hardly expected that you would."
"I consider this fair, since effort will get one farther in life than ease of understanding anyway." 
"Says the man that seems to have skated by through a majority of life on ease of understanding...?"
"I converted to Islam." 
"What? Oh, my God!" "Relax. It's still me and I'm still your friend!"
"I could've sworn I just saw Tom." 
"Here in Thailand? Can't have been."

"Don't you mean 'edgeways'?"
"I couldn't sleep last night because that cat wouldn't shut up with its meowing." 
"Same. I woke up, too." 
"And apparently my neighbor couldn't take it anymore either. When he yelled at the cat to shut up, it ran away, but I was so startled I couldn't go back to sleep."
"I couldn't sleep last night," he said.
"I couldn’t breathe. There’s nothing worse in the world than not being able to draw air into your lungs,” she said.
"I couldn’t eat it", she said apologetically.
"I critically and soberly understand the signal that society gave today to the acting authorities," he said.
"I daren't go and speak to Mary. What if it turns out she can't stand me?" "Then at least you'll know."
"I detect a slight accent. Are you French?" asked Tom, curious. "Belgian," Marie-Emmanuelle replied.
"I detect a slight accent. You're not from round here, are you?" "No," replied Marie-Emmanuelle, smiling. "I'm French."
"I did it. I killed her." 
"Then off to jail."
"I did not buy it," answered the old woman. "I found it in the river where I was washing."
"I did that," she complained, "but there was no water in it!"
"I didn't do anything wrong." 
"Then why did you run?"
"I didn't do it!" said Tom, bursting into tears.
"I didn't eat the cookie," replied Tom with crumbs on his lips.
"I didn't forget you," he said and shook his head.
"I didn't forget you," he said shaking his head.
"I didn't forget you," he said with a shake of the head.
"I didn't go to my classes." 
"How come?"
"I didn't have time to make lunch, I just left... but, how are you doing?" "I'm fine. I'm eating bread with some butter and honey. I'll be back in a little while."

"There's a lot you don't know about him."

"I didn't know." 
"Now you know."
"I didn't see that you were online." 
"Yes, I was in invisible mode."
"I didn't think Tom was your type." 
"I have many types."
"I didn't think Tom was your type." 
"I have more than one type."
"I didn't think about that," said the old man. "What should we do?"
"I didn't think you and Gilbert Blythe were such good friends that you'd stand for half an hour at the gate talking to him," said Marilla with a dry smile.
"I discovered a great website today. It's called the 'Tatoeba project', if you're interested." 
"If you're talking about 'Tatoeba', I've already known about it and have been making submissions for 10 years!"
"I do not care about politics," is like saying: "I do not care about life."

"Liar!"
"I do not regret having gone into the forest and up the mountain," replied the younger brother.
"I do think so; come, I'm not asking for you to give it to me, will you lend it me? I will give it you tomorrow." 
"I am not refusing, but don't abuse it." 
"I won't."
"I don't approve of your behavior." 
"And I don't approve of your disapproval."
"I don't believe Tom." 
"Me neither."

"In Boston."

"In Boston." 
"I don't care."
"I don't care what people think." 
"That's all you care about."

"Are you Jewish?" "No. I'm Muslim."
"I don't drink." 
"But this is juice." 
"No, I mean I don't drink liquids. I only eat food."
"I don't drink." 
"How dare you? No, I'm just kidding."
"I don't eat pork." 
"Jew?" "Muslim."
"I don't feel like drinking today." 
"Come on, it's my birthday!"
"I don't feel like it today. I'll do it tomorrow." 
"You said that yesterday, and the day before."
"I don't get it." 
"Oh, it's an inside joke."
"I don't have a cat, and I never had one!" — "But yes, you had one. Why are you lying then?"
"I don't have a girlfriend because of feminism." 
"Ever think you might be the problem?"
"I don't have any Shawi dress." 
"Well, that's why I am here. Let's go shopping for one."
"I don't have any money." 
"Don't worry. It's my treat."
"I don't have my license with me." 
"No problem, I'll drive."
"I don't have time for philosophy," he said, growing irritated with her word play.
"I don't have time to spend with my kids." 
"You should make time."
"I don't know Mr. Miyake very well, but he's got to be rich. He owns not only his own home, but a separate apartment too, both in quite the expensive areas."
"I don't know anything about their plans" he said.
"I don't know if I should come out and be myself, because my family wouldn't like it." 
"If not yourself, who would you be?"
"I don't know if I should do it. What do you think?" "Hmm... You know what they say: sleep on it."
"I don't know if I should really give Mum this picture." 
"Why not? I'm sure she'll like it."
"I don't know if Ziri is a boy or a girl." 
"He's a boy."
"I don't know what Ziri had for breakfast." 
"Maybe shit."
"I don't know why I'm laughing." 
"Because you're daft!"
"I don't know why I'm laughing." 
"Because you're stupid!"
"I don't know why people think Twitter is so interesting" "Me too."
"I don't know, Tom. What happens when you speak Esperanto in reverse?" said Mary.
"I don't know," admitted Tom.
"I don't know," said Tom.
"I don't know," said Tony.
"I don't know," said the visitor.
"I don't know. I don't keep track of their comings and goings."
"I don't know." 
"You don't know anything, do you?"
"I don't like Nan's cooking," grumbled Mary. "What?" piped up Grandad, his hackles raised. "Time was when we'd have been glad to get such a lovely bit of grub each day!"
"I don't like Tom." 
"I think that he doesn't like you, either."
"I don't like Tom." 
"Neither do I."
"I don't like Tom." 
"That makes two of us."
"I don't like cake." 
"But you like chocolate cake, don't you?" "No, especially not that."
"I don't like carrots." 
"Neither do I."
"I don't like games like this," squeaked the mouse.

"What?"
"I don't like sauerkraut." 
"Here we eat what is on our plate, and you won't stand up until your plate is clean!"
"I don't like sleeping on my own." 
"But Teddy's always with you! And what happened with Plushy, your stuffed bunny?"
"I don't like the friend of our daughter." 
"It's not you to whom he needs to be liked."
"I don't like the new guy." 
"Do you mean Tom? I think that he likes you."
"I don't like thighs." 
"You don't like thighs?!"
"I don't like this hat." 
"How about this one?"
"I don't like this song." 
"I don't, either."
"I don't like to see you crying." 
"Is that true, love?"
"I don't like what's going on." 
"Neither do I."
"I don't like you." 
"Cool. I don't wake up every day to impress you."
"I don't like you." 
"Tell someone who cares."
"I don't like you." 
"You're entitled to your opinion."
"I don't love her." 
"Yes, you do."
"I don't love him." 
"Yes, you do."
"I don't mind if I keep working even after we're married," she said.
"I don't mind this." 
"Well, I do mind!"
"I don't need therapy." 
"That's what they all say."
"I don't need to learn a foreign language. I am a native English speaker", said George.
"I don't see Yanni." 
"He couldn't have gone far."
"I don't see you have any friends." 
"I have friends, they are just virtual ones."
"I don't smoke anymore, didn't you know?" "Since when?" "Today makes three days."
"I don't smoke crack." 
"Good for you." 
"It's all about meth for me."
"I don't think I was crying because I was really so very fond of him," reflected Anne. "I just cried because all the others did."
"I don't think I'll be needing these any more," said Tom, throwing the old books into the paper recycling bin.
"I don't think I'll ever get married." 
"I don't think I will either."
"I don't think I'm wrong about this." 
"I'm sorry, but you are wrong."
"I don't think Tom should do that." 
"Neither do I."
"I don't think Tom will do what we asked." 
"Yeah, me neither."
"I don't think Yanni is ready for another trip." 
"How come?"
"I don't think Yanni is ready for that." 
"How come?"
"I don't think she's an opponent you can ignore like that ..." 
"That's right, they say a cornered rat bites back, don't they?"
"I don't think that fine fellow will trouble us again," he said.
"I don't think that's a good idea." 
"Nonsense! What could possibly go wrong?"
"I don't think that's a good idea." 
"What would you have me do, then?"
"I don't think we should..." 
"We should what?" "Kiss each other."
"I don't think you need alarm yourself," said I. "I have usually found that there was method in his madness." 
"Some folks might say there was madness in his method," muttered the Inspector.
"I don't think you need to wear makeup." 
"What if I want to?"
"I don't think your cat likes me." 
"Oh trust me, she won't leave you alone once she warms up to you."
"I don't think..." 
"Then you shouldn't talk."
"I don't trust her." 
"Me too."
"I don't understand Christmas," said Charlie Brown.
"I don't understand that at all," said little Gerda.
"I don't understand the sentence saying because she wasn't home, she couldn't be reached." 
"It has to be understood in its historical context, where there used to be fixed home telephones and not everyone could be reached anywhere at any time with their phone." 
"Do you mean you could only use your phone at home?" "Or in a phone booth."
"I don't understand this." 
"I don't understand it either."
"I don't understand this." 
"I don't understand it myself."
"I don't understand this." 
"Neither do I."
"I don't understand what's going on." 
"You don't have to."
"I don't understand what's going on." 
"You don't need to."
"I don't understand why I have to learn English, that language of colonizers." 
"That's just how it is." 
"Why is that how it is?"
"I don't understand why Tom acts like that. Didn't you say he was religious?" "Oh, not at all! I said he was malicious."
"I don't understand why Tom always drinks water before eating something." 
"I do that too sometimes. It helps me eat less."
"I don't understand you sometimes, Tom." 
"You're doing better than I am, then, because I never understand you."
"I don't understand you." 
"I don't understand myself."
"I don't understand you." 
"I don't understand you, either."
"I don't understand you." 
"Me neither."
"I don't understand." 
"It's better you don't understand."
"I don't wanna talk to anyone." 
"Not even your sweetheart?"
"I don't want Tom to be here." 
"Me neither."
"I don't want to be a mother like you." 
"Take that back." 
"I won't."
"I don't want to be anyone but myself, even if I go uncomforted by diamonds all my life," declared Anne.
"I don't want to die." 
"You're not going to die."
"I don't want to go right now." 
"Why not?"
"I don't want to go to Boston." 
"Where do you want to go, then?"
"I don't want to go to Boston." 
"Where would you rather go?"
"I don't want to go." 
"It's your call."
"I don't want to have this discussion." 
"Yeah, I bet you don't." 
"Oh, get the hell out of my office." 
"How about out of your life?" "Even better!"
"I don't want to have trouble with Sami." 
"That's two of us, Layla."
"I don't want to talk to anyone." 
"Not even to Grandpa?"
"I don't want you in my house." 
"Are you serious?"
"I don't wish to make things inconvenient." 
"When I have bought the things I need, if I have anything left, I will lend it to you."
"I don't wonder," said Tom.
"I don’t care about that right now; I would rather (if you please) learn from my Catechism about the Lord's Day." 
"As you like."
"I don’t know", said Tony.
"I don’t like carrots." 
"Neither do I."
"I don’t mind if I keep working even after we’re married," she said.
"I don’t think she’s an opponent you can ignore like that ..." 
"That’s right, they say a cornered rat bites back, don’t they?"
"I doubt that even deer want to drink the water," he added. "It's useless."
"I dreamed of you yesterday." 
"Seriously? And what was I doing?"
"I drink," he said, "to the buried that repose around us." 
"And I to your long life."
"I dunno if I should do it. What do you think?" "Hmm... You know, maybe you should sleep on it."
"I enjoy my life and make good money," said Tom.
"I envy you to always find what to say! Me, I'm uninspired! The lid of my brain has closed, for real!", said somebody. A second retorts: "You just have to write about the Coronavirus." The other told him: "I must first know what it is!"
"I farted in the limo." 
"No shit!" "No, I didn't shit, I just farted."
"I fear the rain," said the stone. "What would I say, me!" replied the clod of earth.
"I feel as if we were walking through an enchanted forest," said Anne in a hushed tone.
"I feel better," she said with a winning smile. "Don't you?"
"I feel ill today." 
"What's the matter?"
"I feel ill today." 
"What's up?"
"I feel like a woman, therefore, I'm a woman." 
"Feelings are very fluid and they change."
"I feel like a woman." 
"And how does this make you an actual woman?"
"I feel like it's my fault." 
"Imagine you were watching it happen to someone else. Do you feel differently?" "Yes, but... hmm..."
"I feel like playing cards." 
"So do I."
"I feel like..." Dima started to say. "I feel like I haven't done anything for the last 150,000 sentences."
"I feel like..." Dima started to say. "I feel like I haven’t done anything for the last 150,000 sentences."
"I feel sort of dizzy." 
"You look pale. You'd better take the day off."
"I feel sort of dizzy." 
"You look pale. You’d better take a day off."
"I fell asleep?" "Totally." 
"Really?" "You were very restless, did you have a scary dream?"
"I fell in love with you, not Maria." - "Why have you not let me feel that?"
"I figured it out. I'm not that stupid, you know." 
"Oh, please. Mary has obviously told you everything."
"I fixed the computer." 
"Yeah, right."
"I fled, 'tis true, and saved my life by flight, / bursting my bonds in frenzy of despair, / and hidden in a marish lay that night, / waiting till they should sail, if sail, perchance, they might."
"I forgot to get the tofu!" "Oh, you're useless! You'd better get a shift on, then — shops'll be shut in half an hour!"
"I forgot to say you'll need sandals, so don't forget to bring a pair." 
"What? You should've said that earlier!"
"I forgot to tell you but, I need sandals so bring them." 
"Huh? You should have told me earlier."
"I forgot," she answered.
"I forgot," she said.
"I found Mom's secret stash!" "Where was it?" "In the closet, on the second floor." 
"That’s not Mom's. She wouldn't hide it there." 
"So is it Dad's?" "Not really, I think Dad just forgot it there while drunk. How much is there?" "20,000 yen." 
"So, what do you want to eat?"
"I found some roses growing up this old fence. They're a beautiful pink and smell so sweet." 
"Really? Some roses don't smell at all."
"I found the door locked at four." 
"Yanni's house, Yanni's rules."
"I found this in her purse." 
"Oh my God! That's mine!"
"I gave Link a sankrumi to help him on his way." 
"What's a sankrumi?" "I wonder that myself, really."
"I gave them the job." 
"Why them and not us?"
"I give up! Your religion is like prison..." 
"What do you mean?"
"I got a tan." 
"Sure, a farmer's tan." 
"That's fine with me."
"I got fired." 
"Again?! You're worthless."
"I got fired." 
"Are you serious?"
"I got fired." 
"Honestly, it's been a long time coming. Everyone knows your boss had it out for you."
"I got into an argument with Tom today." 
"Oh, that happens to all of us here all the time. Don't worry about it."
"I got money from my father today, if you happen to need any." 
"I don't right now, but thanks a lot. You offer to do me a favour out of your own generosity and how many would do that?"
"I got nine on my chemistry test. And you?" "The same."
"I got promoted today." 
"Oh, that's awesome!" "Well, I did get promoted, but because of COVID, there was no salary increase. It feels like all I got was more responsibilities." 
"Really? I was going to ask you to treat me, but it seems a bit insensitive given the circumstances. Congratulations anyway!" "Thanks..."
"I got the sack." 
"Seriously?"
"I got to go do something." 
"Shall we order more cake?" "I got to go do something right after this."
"I got you a present, here you go." 
"What, for me?! Thank you!"
"I got you some horseshoe sauce packets." 
"Did you just say horseshoe sauce? Surely you mean horseradish sauce."
"I greet you, dear colleagues, brothers and sisters of the great global human family, who have come together from lands near and far, from the most diverse nations in the world, to shake each other's hands in brotherhood, in the name of a great idea which unites us all...."
"I guess I can sell better than anybody in this office." 
"OK. I think I'll hire you."
"I guess I was just jealous." 
"Jealous of me?"

"Why do you call every breakfast place a Death Star?"
"I might've bought too many sweets." 
"Ah, don't you worry about that. They'll be gone in no time!"
"I miss the Miss." 
"Yes, Alfred, me too. Now go and get me a bottle of wine." 
"As you wish, Sir.
"I miss you." 
"I miss you, too."
"I missed you a lot." 
"I missed you too!"
"I missed you." 
"I missed you too."
"I missed you." 
"I missed you, too."
"I must apologise for calling so late," said he, "and I must further beg you to be so unconventional as to allow me to leave your house presently by scrambling over your back garden wall."
"I must apologise for the state of things" has ended up becoming quite a polite expression these days, hasn't it?
"I must confess that I am out of my depths," said I.
"I must do it. My honor is at stake," said Anne solemnly.
"I must get well," Sadako said to herself.
"I must go pee," Tom said and then left.
"I must take this voyage," he had said to her; "I must go and see the beautiful princess; my parents demand that, but they will never force me to bring her home as my bride; I can never love her!"
"I need a distraction," said Tom.
"I need a sentence that contains the term 'deficit reduction'. Can you help me?" whispered Tom.
"I need a woman who can cook, because I don't know how to." 
"Why not learn how to cook?" "Because I'm lonely." 
"Having basic life skills makes you more attractive."
"I need ammunition, not a ride!" said Volodymyr Zelenskyy when he was offered evacution upon the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
"I need at least SPF 50 to keep from burning."
"I need money." 
"Gah, everyone needs money."
"I need more." 
"Well, there isn't any more."
"I need more." 
"Well, there's no more."
"I need some money," Dima said, with a tone of embarrassment.
"I need to ask you a favor." 
"Sure. What is it?"
"I need to buy a new keyboard." 
"What happened to the old one?" "It stopped responding to keypresses."
"I need to inspect the wound," said the doctor.
"I need to talk to you. It's urgent." 
"Tell me, I'm listening."
"I need you to sign this." 
"What is it?"
"I need your help, Ganon." 
"What? My help? Tell me more." 
"Well, it's a long story. Here's what happened..."
"I need your help, Mary." 
"You always need help. You can't do a thing yourself. Learn to stand on your own two feet!" "Just this once. Please!" "All right then, since it's you."
"I never eat processed food," said Mary.
"I never lie," Tom said proudly.
"I never really thought I would get the job, but here we are," she beamed.
"I never really wanted to travel." 
"Not even when you were my age?" "I was never your age. I was never young."
"I never should have left you." 
"But you did."
"I never thought I'd see you wearing one of those." 
"Well, when in Rome."
"I never thought Tom would win." 
"Me neither."
"I next called upon Madame Charpentier," continued the detective: "I found her very pale and distressed. Her daughter was in the room too—an uncommonly fine girl she is too; she was looking red about the eyes and her lips trembled as I spoke to her. "
"I nipped your national pride, I see." 
"You must have nipped it a long time ago, I can't even remember it."
"I nipped your national pride, I see." 
"You must have nipped it a long time ago, I can’t even remember it."
"I observed it when you entered the chamber," Holmes said.
"I only accept oral sex as payment," Barry said. "Or cash. Cash works too."
"I only hope that we may not have brought trouble on these good men who have sheltered us," he said.
"I only know one surrealist, and that's Salvador Dalí." 
"Then you mean to say you don't know any surrealists."
"I only wished to ask a question," said Holmes, with his finger and thumb in his waistcoat pocket.
"I owe you an apology." 
"I don't see why."
"I passed my exam." 
"I'm glad to hear that!"
"I pay, you play, got it?", said Tom to the guitarist.
"I peeped through Jack's living-room window. There were empty bottles on the table and all over the floor. I think he's back on the booze." 
"His dog died a few weeks ago."
"I pinched your national pride, I see." 
"You must have pinched it a long time ago, I can't even remember it."
"I pinched your national pride, I see." 
"You must have pinched it a long time ago, I can’t even remember it."
"I plan to help Tom steal some cars." 
"That would be unwise."
"I practise sport," she told him. "So do I," he replied to her.
"I prefer the one who does not know to the one who thinks he knows," said the singer Zedek Mouloud.
"I presume that it is Mr. Sherlock Holmes whom I am addressing and not—" "No, this is my friend Dr. Watson."
"I promise I won't laugh if you show me." 
"No way. People who say that always laugh anyways. Go away."
"I promise I'll do it later." 
"There is no later."
"I promise that justice will be done." 
"Yeah, empty promises."
"I promise this won't happen again." 
"This won't happen again? What a joke! Your slut of a girlfriend has just called and she said she's waiting for you outside."
"I promise you," answered the marionette, sobbing, "that from now on I'll be good."
"I promised to pick Mary up from the station, but I don't think I'll make it." 
"When is she arriving?" "In about an hour." 
"You'll easily do it!"
"I put my clothes in the washing machine. Why are they still dirty?" "You forgot to turn it on."
"I quit." 
"Oh, boy!"
"I ran into an old friend yesterday." 
"How long have you known each other?" "Since last month, but he's over ninety years old."
"I ran out without any shoes, ran out without anything because things were exploding all the way around us," Hornback said.
"I rather like heights. You know, in my last life I must have been ... an aeroplane?" "Usually that would be 'bird' there."
"I rather like heights. You know, in my last life I must have been ... an aeroplane?" "Usually that would be ’bird’ there."
"I read every article I see about depression." 
"Great! That's definitely going to raise your spirits."
"I read that Tibetans have group marriages." 
"Is it true?"
"I read three books this month." 
"No you didn't; you listened to them." 
"Shut up, Tom; you're a dick."
"I really beg your pardon!" said my companion, who had ruffled the little man's temper by bursting into an explosion of laughter.
"I really can't stand the smell of tea." 
"It'll help."
"I really do," replied the little black rabbit.
"I really had a great time with you tonight." 
"I had a great time too."
"I really like it here," he said.
"I really like this cold weather," he said. There speaks someone who sleeps in a warm bed at night.
"I really like you." 
"I like you, too, Mennad."
"I really love this towel." 
"Keep it."
"I really love this towel." 
"Keep it." 
"Oh, thank you!"
"I really need new clothes" thought Dima.
"I really need some new clothes," thought Dima.
"I reckon it's about to rain." 
"I do as well."
"I refuse to herd geese any longer with that girl." 
"For what reason?" asked the old King. "Because she does nothing but annoy me all day long," replied Curdken.
"I refuse to let you marry that man," said her father.
"I refuse to sell my soul," Tom declared.
"I remember, as if it was yesterday, the locusts that ravaged our vines; from east to west, they were rushing; our community couldn't take it anymore ...", sang Idir in his song "Cfiɣ".
"I resent the implication that I am a religious conservative," said the social Darwinist. "What I actually worship is reified tradition masquerading as 'science'."
"I respect you and consider it a great honour to shake your hand!" he continued solemnly.
"I s'pose you've been to Christminster, Physician?" "I have—many times," replied the long thin man. "That's one of my centres."
"I said no kissing!" "Sorry, I couldn't resist."
"I said no soda pop." 
"It's not soda. It's juice."
"I said that I wouldn't cry!" "It's okay, don't worry about it."
"I sailed around the Mediterranean in a schooner when I was seventeen," she recited slowly and carefully.
"I sat down next to Tom." 
"I don't believe you."
"I saw Tom today." 
"Who?!"
"I saw a bridge in the sky, a bridge of seven colours." 
"Otherwise known as a rainbow."
"I saw a cat out of the corner of my eye, but then it disappeared." 
"Was it black?" "It was." 
"That's just the shadow cat. It lives in the shadow dimension and sometimes shows up when our dimensions move particularly close to each other. It's harmless."
"I saw a dolphin down there." 
"Where?"
"I saw a dolphin over there." 
"Where?"
"I saw a giant purple monkey and it was eating a bowl of beautiful goats," said no one, ever.
"I saw an alien!" shrieked Tom. "Really?" quipped Mary.
"I saw her five days ago," he said.
"I saw her..." 
"Yes, carry on." 
"I ... saw her..." 
"Yes?" "I saw..." 
"Why are you crying?"
"I saw it coming!" "Yeah, yeah. In hindsight, we all saw it coming."
"I saw it!" "Nope! You didn't see it!"
"I saw more than the others because I was on the shoulders of giants," said Isaac Newton.
"I saw the pictures." 
"What pictures?"
"I saw you kissing that bitch." 
"Wait, let me explain." 
"Don't touch me, you dirty pig!" "Don't call me pig in front of the kids!" "I said don't touch me! Leave me alone, you cheap bastard!"
"I saw you kissing the other time." 
"Oh, but please don't think we're together!" "Sure! I believe you!"
"I scored an overhead kick straight from a corner with my left foot on the rec last night." 
"Yeah, dream on!" "I did!"
"I see Tom. He's heading for the parking lot." 
"Don't let him out of your sight."
"I see Tom. He's heading for the parking lot." 
"Don't lose sight of him."
"I see it makes you laugh, Tom?" - "Alas, Mary. It could be really funny if it weren't so sad."
"I see," Dima sighed. "Sorry for the confusion, then. Enjoy your Fanta, and have a good day."
"I see," said the blind man, as he picked up his hammer and saw.
"I see," said the blind man.
"I sent Tom the documents yesterday. Now it's a matter of waiting until we hear from him." 
"How long might that take?" "Up to now, he's always replied within a fortnight."
"I shall always feel," the young man said thoughtfully, "that in these days I have lived very near great things."
"I shall be most happy to tell you anything I can," the constable answered, with his eyes upon the little golden disk.
"I shall buy a new house. How about you?" "No, I will not buy one."
"I shall go to the market this afternoon. How about you?" "No, I will not go."
"I shall go when I think proper," said Charles, "and not at your will and pleasure; it is well known that whatever we do, we two together, the king will be content therewith."
"I shall never forgive Gilbert Blythe," said Anne firmly.
"I shall not get out of your way," said the white puss, who had got the best place first.
"I shall win the king's daughter!" they both cried.
"I shit my pants." 
"Yes, I can see that."
"I shit my pants." 
"Yes, I can smell that."
"I should be most happy to go down with you if I should not be in the way," said I.
"I should have told you the truth in the first place." 
"Then why didn't you?"
"I should have used a condom," lamented Tom.
"I should thank you." 
"What for?"
"I should've bought some soft serve, too..." 
"You want a bite?" "Yeah!"
"I shouldn't have..." 
"Oh, cut it out, Ziri. I won't forgive you this time."
"I smell a rat", I said to him.
"I smell shit." 
"It's Yanni's dog."
"I smell something." 
"It's couscous."
"I still don't know how to do it." 
"It doesn't matter. Just do it. And you'll know how to do it."
"I still live in poverty!" "My dear, there is poverty in every situation if you really look for it. Even people with lots of money live with some kind of poverty... Look at the bright side!"
"I still love you." 
"Go to hell."
"I stole beans but I peeled them skilfully", said Lounes Matoub when he was reproached for being inspired by the chaâbi musical genre; it is still necessary to know that the Kabyles are part of its pioneers and continue to shape it.
"I support the LGB community, but not the Ts." 
"LGB includes most T. There has never been a mythical LGB community that didn't include trans people. That's why it was added."
"I suppose she has some good qualities," conceded Mr. Harrison grudgingly.
"I supposed I could go in there now?" "Go through."
"I swear this trash is so overrated it makes me sick." 
"You like?" "Not a bit." 
"Great! I will make more then. See you later!"
"I swear, I've never had food as good as this before." 
"But that's a reheated week-old McDouble. What were your parents feeding you? Poor thing."
"I talked to Melissa yesterday." 
"Who is Melissa?"
"I think Belgium is a better team and will win the match tomorrow." 
"Maybe so."
"I think I can break down the door," whispered Mary. "Step aside for a bit, please."
"I think I forgot to put money in my wallet." 
"Huh?" "I still have my cards, though...Ah, I don't have my wallet. I must've forgot it. Oh well." 
"You meant to leech from the start, didn't you?" "No, no, I actually forgot it."
"I think I lost my earphones whilst walking and I haven't been able to find them." 
"Surely you would've noticed when the music stopped playing after they came off?" "I put them in my pocket."
"I think I might possibly be your son." 
"What?!"
"I think I need a stiff drink." 
"Make that two."
"I think I really love you, Mary." 
"I love you too."
"I think I saw a ghost there." 
"It wasn't a ghost. It was Yanni sitting alone in the dark."
"I think I sold it for drugs, but I can't remember." 
"If you can't remember, you probably sold it for drugs." 
"Yeah, well, it might've been for necessities after I had already bought drugs."
"I think I understood everything," Tom said, "but I'm not absolutely sure."
"I think I'd better come back another time." 
"Stay. Sit down."
"I think I'll get going." 
"What do you mean?" "I'm not in the mood for Peter. If I'd known he was here, I wouldn't have come."
"I think I'll have a drink." 
"I think I'll have one, too."
"I think I'm going crazy." 
"No, you aren't. Crazy people don't think they're going crazy. They think they're getting smarter."
"I think I'm going to be sick." 
"Can you make it to the loo?"
"I think I'm going to make chicken parmesan for dinner tonight," said Matthew as he grabbed his grocery list.
"I think I've seen this expression before." 
"Yes, it's even googleable."
"I think Mary likes you." 
"What makes you think that?"
"I think Mary's into me." 
"I doubt it. You're not her type."
"I think Rima is lesbian." 
"Look, you need to get rid of these stupid thoughts."
"I think Tom likes Mary." 
"Isn't that obvious?"
"I think Tom should do that." 
"So do I."
"I think Tom should do that." 
"Why Tom?"
"I think Tom stole my drink." 
"Really? I don't think he'd ever do something like that."
"I think Tom will be there." 
"So do I."
"I think Tom's a bit tipsy." 
"A bit tipsy? He just threw up on Mary!"
"I think Tom's a bit tipsy." 
"That's an understatement. He just threw up on Mary."
"I think Trump will be less worse than Clinton." 
"I couldn't disagree more."
"I think all fat people should go on a diet". "Are you referring to me"?
"I think he is a very disagreeable man," said Anne, with a resentful toss of her ruddy head.
"I think his thinking process is like this: 'You don't need to be my girlfriend to spend the whole day and night with me. However, you should behave like my girlfriend when you're with me, but I don't need to tell anyone else that I am not single anymore,'" she explained.
"I think it is exhausting, but today's troubles will surely be rewarded." 
"Don't say such half-minded things! I know you don't think that whatsoever."
"I think it is gone," he said. But it was not gone.
"I think it'll soon be raining." 
"So do I."
"I think it's Arabic." 
"No, it's Berber."
"I think it's Tom at the door." 
"Who else would it be?"
"I think it's about to rain." 
"So do I."
"I think it's feasible. Should we try?" "We can always dream..."
"I think it's going to rain soon." 
"Me too."
"I think it's going to rain soon." 
"So do I."
"I think it's just worth it to end it all." 
"What do you mean?"
"I think it's kinda weird," he said.
"I think my card is working." 
"But my machine isn't." 
"Oh no what a mess."
"I think my ideal temperature is like 68." 
"No, your ideal temperature is 98.6, same as mine."
"I think my radio burned out when we lost electricity." 
"But doesn't it run on batteries?"
"I think perfection is ugly", he said. "Somewhere in the things that humans make, I want to see scars, failure, disorder, distortion."
"I think rats are very intelligent, and they can be amazing animals," she said.
"I think so, too," she chimed in.
"I think that this is inappropriate." 
"What's inappropriate about it?"
"I think this wine is really good." 
"I've had better."
"I think trauma is a gift." 
"I think anything it teaches us wasn't worth it."
"I think we have done all that can be done," he answered; "it's a queer case though, and I knew your taste for such things."
"I think we should clean the carburetor." 
"I already tried that."
"I think we should leave already." 
"Me too."
"I think we should leave now." 
"Me, too."
"I think we shouldn't be doing this." 
"No one asked you."
"I think we're lost." 
"It's quite possible."
"I think we're lost." 
"That may well be."
"I think we're lost." 
"We may well be."
"I think we're lost." 
"We might well be."
"I think women belong in the kitchen." 
"I think this shoe belongs in your mouth."
"I think you like your job." 
"On the contrary, I hate it."
"I think you owe me about thirty dollars." 
"That seems about right."
"I think you should go out with Tom." 
"No, I don't like him."
"I think you'd make a cute couple." 
"Whaat?"
"I think you're stupid," said Mary.
"I think, therefore I am," said René Descartes.
"I thought I told Tom to mind his own business." 
"And yet, here we are."
"I thought Mary lived in Florida." 
"No, she's a snowbird."
"I thought Tom's joke was really funny." 
"I didn't, and I don't think Mary did, either."
"I thought that Tom was going to kill me." 
"So, did he kill you?" "No, he didn't, you idiot! Do I look like a ghost to you?"
"I thought that you were in Baker Street working out that case of blackmailing." 
"That was what I wished you to think."
"I thought this was a gay bar." 
"That's a common misunderstanding about The Bear Den."
"I thought you had been dead this thirty years, Henry," said she, in a shaking voice.
"I thought you kept bees." 
"Nah, I just give them a place to live. I don't take their honey and try not to disturb them."
"I thought you liked him." 
"I do."
"I thought you liked kids, Tom." 
"Nah, fuck kids. I will beat any kid in a fight."
"I thought you loved Sami." 
"I did, but it's over now."
"I thought you might like to see this." 
"What is it?"
"I thought you said Tom lost his job." 
"Maybe I was wrong."
"I thought you were Hispanic." 
"No, I'm a Métis."
"I thought you were Hispanic." 
"No, I’m Iranian."
"I thought you were Hispanic..." 
"No, I'm Egyptian!"
"I thought you were Japanese." 
"No, I'm a Mexican."
"I thought you were Japanese." 
"No, I'm from Nunavut."
"I thought you were Japanese." 
"No, I'm from Uruguay."
"I thought you were Jewish." 
"I am, but I don't keep kosher."
"I thought you were asleep." 
"Me too."
"I thought you were coming with me." 
"You thought wrong."
"I thought you were from Slovakia." 
"I'm from Slovenia."
"I thought you were gay." 
"I'm bi."
"I thought you were gluten-free, Esther." 
"No, I'm vegan."
"I thought you'd give this laughter its due." 
"This is crud; they're laughing at me!" "You don't say?"
"I told Mary that I do not have time for a relationship because I have to focus on school," Tom said dutifully to his father. "I'm glad to hear that, my boy," he replied contentedly, patting his son on the shoulder. "There is enough time for such things later."
"I told one of my students yesterday that he was wrong, and he threw a fit!" "Well, maybe it was the way you told him." 
"You know I've got a knack for this kind of situation." 
"Uh-huh, sure..."
"I told the other kids all about how our train hit a person, and that's why we were delayed." 
"Oh my God, no you didn't, really? The teacher is going to call me. . ." 
"Everyone wanted to know if the person died, and I said they went to the hospital." 
"First you were telling kids about the war in Ukraine, now this? Please don't talk about this stuff at school honey. Some kids will be upset."
"I told you to be careful." 
"Whatever."
"I told you to wake me up at 7." 
"Sorry, I forgot."
"I told you to wake me up at seven." 
"Sorry, I forgot."
"I told you, I like to be alone." 
"So do I! Let's do it together!"
"I took Journalism in high school." 
"Splendid!"
"I tried some seaweed today after not eating any for a while, and it was delicious." 
"In Japan, it's often part of a meal. Is that less common in the U.S.?" "I think it's common in most families, but not really in mine."
"I understand Italian perfectly," she boasted while choosing a dish from the menu, but when the food was served, it was not at all what she expected.
"I understand exactly what you're saying." 
"You do?"
"I understand how you feel, Hiroshi," says Mike.
"I understand you borrow some money from Yanni." 
"Yes, why?"
"I unlocked the safe." 
"Yeah, right."
"I use wheat alongside oats and yam flour to produce that particular one," Orizu said.
"I used to like you." 
"Does this mean you don't like me now?"
"I used to like you." 
"Used to?"
"I usually get support by going to public places with background noise. I need to be with friends because I get a lot of energy from social activities. So I just felt very low energy and low mood, and it was really hard to find the energy to do homework," she said.
"I wanna have a word with you." 
"Sure, what is it?"
"I wanna take a dump." 
"Use the bucket."
"I want a big, happy family." 
"How big?"
"I want a divorce." 
"No, it's not like this."
"I want a divorce." 
"What? Are you out of your mind?"
"I want a dog, but I'm worried I won't be able to take care of one." 
"Try a houseplant first."
"I want a house to keep me warm," he said.
"I want a pet pig." 
"Do you know how big they are?" "Yeah, but you don't have to feed them so much and get them so fat if you're not eating them." 
"Oh, come on, you gotta have a fat pig!"
"I want a pint of beer." 
"It's eight in the morning, Tom!"
"I want a refund on this love potion." 
"I'm sorry, but this item is non-refundable."
"I want ice cream." 
"After dinner."
"I want my dark elf to be blue." 
"OK... That one's purple. You'll be purple for this week."
"I want my dark elf to be blue." 
"OK... That one’s purple. You’ll be purple for this week."
"I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be friends?"
"I want some more." 
"I'm sorry, we don't have any more."
"I want something to happen." 
"Like what?" "I don't know."
"I want that book", he said to himself.
"I want that book," he said to himself.
"I want the money." 
"Yes, soon."
"I want to be a billionaire, like my uncle." 
"Your uncle is a billionaire?" "He wants to be a billionaire, too."
"I want to be a farmer," said Pip.
"I want to be like you." 
"What do you mean?" "I want to be a Muslim."
"I want to become Muslim." 
"What? Do you want to be Arab?" "No. I said that I wanted to be Muslim."
"I want to buy some flowers for my balcony." 
"It's probably a bit early for that. It's still winter weather." 
"That's all right. I'll keep the pots in the flat to start with."
"I want to buy things," the boy said.
"I want to buy your laptop." 
"Now we're getting somewhere."
"I want to climb this tree," said the boy.
"I want to convert to Islam." 
"Islam is going to change your life." 
"I'm ready for that change."
"I want to die." 
"First, I pray you, learn what it is to live."
"I want to die." 
"You'd like that, wouldn't you? Lying in a coffin all day doing nothing."
"I want to drop out of school and dedicate myself entirely to music." 
"Think about what you're doing!"
"I want to embody evil so that no one carries me on his back", goes a Kabyle saying.
"I want to get a haircut soon." 
"Huh, already?"
"I want to get my own piano, but there's no room for it." 
"What do you mean, 'there's no room'? Your room is pretty much empty!"
"I want to get rid of Ziri." 
"Consider it done."
"I want to give three apples to each of my four children. How many apples do I have to buy?" "Twelve apples!"
"I want to go home." 
"So do I."
"I want to go to Kabylie." 
"Forget it."
"I want to kiss you." 
"OK. Let's go somewhere private."
"I want to kiss you." 
"Sorry, I'm not that kind of girl."
"I want to kiss your sweet lips." 
"If you want them, come get them."
"I want to kiss your sweet lips." 
"If you want them, you'll have to come get them."
"I want to learn Berber." 
"Me too."
"I want to learn Berber." 
"What did you say?" "You heard me."
"I want to learn Berber." 
"Why don't you go to Kabylie?"
"I want to learn Latin and Greek myself." 
"A lofty desire. You must get a grammar of each tongue."
"I want to learn Latin." 
"What did you say?" "I said that I want to learn Latin."
"I want to learn about the lost continent Mu." 
"It sounds interesting!"
"I want to learn words that are useful in Israel." 
"That excludes please, excuse me and thank you."
"I want to live in Algeria." 
"You're welcome."
"I want to love without restraint." 
"That sounds boring." 
"Why?" "I like it kinky." 
"Oh! That's not what I meant." 
"I know."
"I want to make this miso soup again, but we don't have any Wakame seaweed," Mary said whilst looking at the open recipe book on the table. "Then go and get some!" Tom responded.
"I want to move to Cairo." 
"Seriously?"
"I want to play cards." 
"Me too! Me too!"
"I want to propose to Skura." 
"And would you marry a girl that doesn't speak a word of Berber?" "Why not?"
"I want to see a dinosaur!" "Which one: the one that will brutally maul you or the one that will accidentally crush you beneath its feet?" "N-not all dinosaurs are like that!"
"I want to see you smile." 
"Be content with what you don't have."
"I want to sit in your seat." 
"If you want that, then let's change seats!"
"I want to speak to a manager!" screamed Karen.
"I want to start a business here." 
"Do it in Algeria instead."
"I want to talk to your grandfather." 
"That's not possible, he died a few years back."
"I want you to make the bed, clean up the desk, buy groceries and make breakfast." 
"Do you have a song request as well?"
"I want you to meet my parents." 
"Sorry, I don't do parents."
"I wanted a balcony with a view of the sea." 
"Then why did you buy a farm in Iowa?"
"I wanted to see you," said Dorothea, having no other words at command.
"I was a bit uncomfortable," said Tom.
"I was about to ask," said the Doctor, "whether you had heard aught of that same young gentleman."
"I was an investment banker, the child of refugees, who felt unfulfilled with their own life and my contribution to society,” he said. “So I felt young people had to choose: be good or be cold-hearted investment bankers. So I created The Hult Prize as a platform to equip them, arm them, and then deploy capital to these young people and their ideas; capital that can help them change the world."
"I was born as the oldest son of a farmer in Akita," Suga said.
"I was born in Algeria." 
"Lucky you."
"I was born on Earth." 
"Yeah, yeah, that's what they all say."
"I was busy." 
"Busy doing what?"
"I was falling in love with you." 
"Was?!"
"I was first." 
"Seriously?"
"I was going to go to the cinema with Tom this evening. Are you coming?" "Yeah, would love to. What's on?"
"I was in the popular kid group." 
"Really, Tom, really?"
"I was just admiring your roses. They're absolutely gorgeous." 
"Oh, I'm flattered. Thank you."
"I was just admiring your roses. They’re absolutely gorgeous." 
"Oh, I’m flattered. Thank you."
"I was just asking a question." 
"Mind your own business."
"I was just cleaning and found a few things." 
"Did you see my red shirt?" "Unfortunately, no."
"I was just on my way over to invite you to help me celebrate my birthday on Saturday," said Anne.
"I was just talking to Tom." 
"About what?" "About what Mary did."
"I was just talking to him." 
"Talking to him about what?"
"I was just talking to him." 
"Talking to him about what?" "That's none of your business."
"I was just wondering, are you the boss of this place?" "Well, sort of. Now, 'intruder detected'! That means I have to kill you." 
"I really shouldn't have asked that, should I?"
"I was killed by too powerful a word!" said the poet.
"I was longing for something to do." 
"You shall have it then."
"I was only trying to help." 
"Except you just got in the way."
"I was pleased to hear you're from the area. So, you're a Town fan, then?" "City supporter, I'm afraid." 
"What? You're having a laugh." 
"No. Straight up." 
"That is unbelievable! A City fan among us!"
"I was really asking myself whether it was bacon or pork," as Michel Rocard said.
"I was shocked," Mary said.
"I was shocked," Tom said.
"I was so angry today." 
"Oh yeah?" "You-know-who said some very strange things again. You listening?"
"I was so scared," said Elias, and Sandra nodded knowingly.
"I was sure that you would trust me," she cried, with a great sigh of relief.
"I was surprised Rima helped me." 
"Yeah, 'surprised' is the right word."
"I was talking to Tom Cruise once (a really close friend of mine), and I was telling him about the latest antics of my pal Charlie Sheen. We sat there talking for about an hour when I got a call from Jay Leno. He wanted me to be on his show next week. I was pretty busy, but I told Jay I would find time in my schedule for his show. Oh, I have to be off." 
"Here are your bags and change, sir." 
"Thanks." 
"Thank you, sir, have a great day."
"I was talking with Tom." 
"About what?" "About what Mary did."
"I was thinking about Anne," she explained. "She's got to be such a big girl--and she'll probably be away from us next winter. I'll miss her terrible."
"I was very shocked," Mary said.
"I was very shocked," Tom said.
"I was working as a waiter back then." 
"In a cocktail bar?" "How did you know?"
"I wasn't talking about Marie, but Maria." 
"Oh, I get it now. Thanks, Mary."
"I weigh 140 kilos." 
"And you wonder why you can't get a girlfriend."
"I went drinking with one of my boyfriend's friends, and now he's furious at me." 
"Was this friend a guy or a girl?" "A guy, obviously. Why would I go drinking with his female friends?" "Yeah, you're right." 
"His name is Tom. He's really hot, and I really want to go drinking with him again."
"I went out for some okonomiyaki yesterday." 
"Nice! I'm jealous." 
"I also took some pictures. Want to see them?" "Yeah! Ohh, they look so good." 
"This white one over here is double cheese. Let's try it whenever we go together."
"I went to Boston." 
"Where else did you go?" "I went to Chicago, too."
"I went to Germany as an exchange student to interact with people, take classes in a different country and experience a new country and culture. But once Germany began implementing stricter policies and shutting down schools, the reason as to why I went to Germany vanished," Jeong said.
"I went to a concert last night." 
"How was it?"
"I went to a gig last night." 
"How was it?"
"I went to the ballet yesterday with Mary." 
"So how was it?" "No joy. Well, except for the aesthetic, of course."
"I went to the concert last night." 
"How was it?"
"I went to the gig last night." 
"How was it?"
"I will die without you." 
"I'll go to your funeral."
"I will do everything right", she swore to her mother.
"I will do it," said the little mermaid as pale as death.
"I will do it," said the little mermaid, and she became pale as death.
"I will get you a Kabyle dress." 
"Promise?" "Promise."
"I will give it back today." 
"You should have added, 'with God's help'."
"I will grow many trees here", he said to himself.
"I will let you pass safely," the Sphinx said, "if you can answer my riddle."
"I will not press you, nor can I really, but at least lend me your book." 
"Take it, use it as you please, but do not abuse it." 
"There’s nothing to worry about here."
"I will talk with Mary as soon as possible.", Tom thought to himself.
"I will trust you on one condition, and on one condition only," said I at last.
"I will willingly write it out for you, but wait until tomorrow." 
"I will wait then, but do not fail to do it, please." 
"I will not fail."
"I will willingly write out for you, but stay till tomorrow." 
"I will stay then, but do not fail, I pray." 
"I will not fail."
"I wish I could be with you." 
"You're with me." 
"What do you mean?" "Turn around."
"I wish I could trade places with Tom." 
"Tom and I are just friends." 
"And what are we?" "We're not even that."
"I wish I spoke English." 
"Learn it."
"I wish I was part of a worldwide volunteer vigilante nunchuck patrol. I'd be like swish-swish-smash! Oh, sorry I broke your arm, criminal," said Tom.
"I wish someone would just tell this person to zip it." 
"Well, why don't you be that someone?"
"I wish we could consider the kindnesses of God towards us as we do those of men." 
"May He allow us to exercise that thought more often and more diligently." 
"That really is necessary if we are going to experience His kindness more often."
"I wish we were rich, too, honey," said Mom, taking my hand.
"I wish you were all mine!" said the little black rabbit.
"I wish you would tell me about yourself," he said gently.
"I woke up to Cookie barking." 
"That parrot is something else."
"I won't eat that." 
"That's your problem. You'll remain hungry."
"I won't let you hurt my friends!" "I wasn't going to hurt your friends."
"I won't waste your time," said he, raising himself upon the sofa.
"I wonder if I should buy this workbook." 
"Even though you won't do the exercises?" "Did you say something?"
"I wonder if Peter's still cross." 
"Oh, he's long since over it."
"I wonder if Tom can write love letters in French yet." 
"Why on earth do you wonder that?" "Well, he's keen on that Marie-Emmanuelle, isn't he." 
"Don't tell me you're jealous!" "Yes, I am! All right?"
"I wonder if Yumi is still up?" "I think she's probably sleeping. I mean, it's three in the morning in Japan."
"I wonder if it'll rain tomorrow." 
"I don't think it will."
"I wonder if it's stopped raining." 
"I hope so."
"I wonder if it's stopped raining." 
"That'd be nice."
"I wonder if there's a way to fix his personality." 
"Listen, Tom, a person's personality doesn't change that easily."
"I wonder what ground cinnamon tastes like," said the King nonchalantly and put the spoon in his mouth. "Hmm? ...Shit! Water... water... in the fridge. Oh crap, no water in the fridge!" The King went on running around the room frantically, looking desperately for water. Luckily, Duke Onkled happened to be pouring himself a glass of water. "Your Omnipotence, have water," he offered dutifully. "Gimme!" demanded the King, then emptied the glass in a split second. "Damn, that was awful."
"I wonder what that fellow is looking for?" I asked, pointing to a stalwart, plainly-dressed individual who was walking slowly down the other side of the street, looking anxiously at the numbers.
"I wonder what this is", asked Tony.
"I wonder what this is," said Tony.
"I wonder what this is?" asked Tony.
"I wonder what's for supper." 
"What? How about dinner?" "No. What's dinner?" "Oh you piece of shit. All true warriors eat dinner!" "Hmm? I wonder what 'dinner' means." 
"Oh you—" "Enough! Zelda, what is dinner?" "You've got to be kidding." 
"Fuck you! Ganon, what is dinner?" "You must first join me." 
"Hell no. Duke Onkled, what is dinner?" "Oh please." 
"Mama Luigi, what is dinner?" "Well, like they say in Brooklyn: early to bed, early to catch the worm. Or, is it the bagel?" "What? Enough is enough, what the fuck is dinner?!" "Okay, okay. Here, have this dictionary." 
"Hmm... Dinner... What? Dinner is supper?" "Yeah!" "You shittin' me?"
"I wonder whether I'll ever get better." 
"Don't say that, Yumi. You'll get better. I know you will. So pull yourself together."
"I wonder why ghosts only appear at night." 
"Really? I've seen them in the daytime." 
"Are you serious?"
"I wonder why you always lose just one sock out of a pair." 
"If you lost both, you wouldn't notice it, right?" "Yeah, I guess you're right."
"I wonder why you didn't stay at home given that he is coming." 
"He wouldn't have allowed it, nor would I want to, as the lesson is to be heard."
"I wonder, is Tom really a boy?" "What do you mean?" "Well, I mean, he's just so cute, plus he behaves like a girl..."
"I work at the zoo." 
"Oh, what do you do there?" "I'm one of the monkeys."
"I work in Australia." 
"I do, too."
"I work in Australia." 
"I work in Australia, too."
"I work in Australia." 
"Me, too."
"I work in Boston." 
"I do, too."
"I work in Boston." 
"I work in Boston, too."
"I work in Boston." 
"Me, too."
"I work on a farm," said Tom.
"I worship the Most High." 
"Snoop Dogg?"
"I would like to ask you a question." 
"Shoot." 
"What is your opinion regarding the recent changes to the government's economic policy?" "No comment. Next question!"
"I would like to test your capacity for logical thinking. Please have a look at this. These are pictures of Kira. I would like to see what you can tell from them." 
"This isn't Kira. It's me. I'm not Kira." 
"Bravo. You have a sharp mind."
"I would like your assurance that you will do what I said," Mary said coldly.
"I would love to go to the dance with you." 
"Really? You would?"
"I would never offer an opinion about something of which I'm ignorant." If only most people thought this way!
"I would rather live in Hell than America." 
"Interesting. I personally wouldn't want to move to Hell, as bad as America is."
"I would say having a romantic relationship with a person from different cultures/countries was not much different than a relationship with a person from the same country/culture," Jan said.
"I wouldn't touch Tom's shepherd's pie with a bargepole," Mary snorted.
"I wrote this poem when..." 
"Just read it!"
"I'd do almost anything in the world for you, Diana," said Anne sadly. "I'd let myself be torn limb from limb if it would do you any good. But I can't do this, so please don't ask it."
"I'd just like to have a discussion" is often missionary jargon for, "If I told you why I was really here, you'd tell me to fuck off."
"I'd like a glass of tap water." 
"That'll be a euro. We don't give anything away here for nothing. A fine thing that would be!"
"I'd like a glass of water — tap water." 
"We don't serve tap water here. Water costs €3.30, as it says on the menu."
"I'd like to add some beauty to life," said Anne dreamily.
"I'd like to have a coffee after work." 
"I would too."
"I'd like to learn Japanese, but I don't fancy studying the script." 
"Then you should give up your plan to learn Japanese, here and now."
"I'd like to make this soup," said Mary, an open cookery book in front of her on the table, "but I need some wakame." 
"You can get that from the Asian food shop in Schiller Street," replied Tom. "They've got it? Let's go there now, then!"
"I'd like to play cards." 
"So would I."
"I'd like to see the breakfast menu." 
"Certainly, sir."
"I'd like to speak to Yanni in private." 
"OK." 
"I said in private. Please wait outside." 
"Oh, sorry. Sure."
"I'd like to speak to the manager," said Karen.
"I'd like to start a multipolar world." 
"Cool, do it without invading Ukraine."
"I'd like to stay here for ever." 
"Then stay!" "But it's not possible!"
"I'd like to talk to Mr Smith." 
"This is Smith speaking."
"I'd like to talk to you about the birds and the bees, son." 
"What would you like to know, dad?"
"I'd look like a real James Bond in that," Dima said to himself, then entered the store.
"I'd rather get the sack than not join the labour union," said the disgruntled worker.
"I'd rather go back to the asylum than go to live with her," said Anne passionately.
"I'd sooner walk than take my chances in an antediluvian rattle-trap like that," said the tall wayfarer, bending quite close to her ear.
"I'll always be with you." 
"That's why I love you."
"I'll answer your question later, all right? I've got to think about it first." 
"Take your time. Don't forget me, though, will you?"
"I'll astonish you," said Tom, putting his hand in his pocket.
"I'll be back in a minute," he added.
"I'll be back," said Tom.
"I'll be here again on Friday, so see you then. Bye-Bye." 
"Yeah, I'll be off now."
"I'll be on my way, then. See you later!" "I guess I'd better go, too."
"I'll be working all weekend." 
"Why? What happened to the other cleaning lady?" "Oh, so I'm a cleaning lady now? Thank you for the promotion."
"I'll bring my dog along, so you can meet him." 
"What?! Don't you dare bring that animal here!"
"I'll bring you some coffee." 
"Thanks very much."
"I'll come again." 
"Yeah, I look forward to it."
"I'll come at once, I'll just comb myself before", said Chewbacca in his own language.
"I'll come over and help you finish your homework." 
"Thank you. I'd like that very much."
"I'll do anything," she said.
"I'll do it tomorrow." 
"You said that yesterday!"
"I'll do my best" often means "I won't initiate anything".
"I'll do my best" often means "I'll initiate nothing".
"I'll do my best." 
"Well, I only hope your best is good enough, Tom."
"I'll do that later." 
"When later?"
"I'll do that tomorrow." 
"That's what you said yesterday."
"I'll drop you on my way." 
"If you insist."
"I'll follow her," he said, hurriedly; "she must be an accomplice, and will lead me to him."
"I'll follow you wherever you go," she told him.
"I'll fuck you up." 
"How are you going to do that?" "You'll find out."
"I'll get to class on time," I thought.
"I'll give 50 thousand for this statue." 
"Who will give more?"
"I'll give you four pennies for your A-B-C book," said a ragpicker who stood by.
"I'll give you twenty bucks for it." 
"Nothing doing. Thirty dollars; take it or leave it." 
"Fine, then I guess I'll take my business elsewhere."
"I'll grant you three wishes," said the genie.
"I'll hang the sheets myself," the neighbor said. "It's not like they're that heavy."
"I'll have some of that," said Tom, loading his plate with potato salad.
"I'll have the green curry." 
"Green curry, OK, and how spicy would you like that?" "Uh, pretend I'm Thai." 
"Thai hot, OK."
"I'll have two double cheeseburgers, a small order of fries, a large soda, and an apple pie." 
"Uh, could you, like, get less stuff?"
"I'll have whisky, please!" "All I've got is tea or nothing."
"I'll help you." 
"You're my hero."
"I'll look up the phone number." 
"Wait, I have to turn on my computer first."
"I'll make meat strips out of Tom if I get my hands on him!" "Now, because of you, I'm hungry! Just tell me that you'll cut him into kindling! "
"I'll need to be getting home soon." 
"Already? Can't we play a little longer?" "I'm really sorry, but if I'm any later I'll get told off by mummy."
"I'll never let myself be protected by a man" is what she said, but she seems to be perfectly fine letting herself get escorted around by a guy that she likes.
"I'll never marry." 
"I'll never marry either."
"I'll never understand women," said Tom.
"I'll pay you all you want. Just let me go." 
"Look around. Do you think I'm poor?"
"I'll pay you." 
"I'm not doing this for money."
"I'll pick you up from the airport when you arrive." 
"Thanks! I look forward to seeing you!"
"I'll really miss this house." 
"We'll all miss it, Tom."
"I'll see you tomorrow." 
"You know it."
"I'll sell you mine with pleasure—those I used as a student." 
"Oh, thank you, sir!" said Jude gratefully, but in gasps, for the amazing speed of the physician's walk kept him in a dog-trot which was giving him a stitch in the side.
"I'll sleep when I'm dead," said Tom.
"I'll tag along with you for a bit." 
"Why? You live in the opposite direction." 
"Yeah, but I need to stop by the supermarket."
"I'll tell Tom!" "Go on, then, tell him!" "Then you'll be in trouble!" "So what!"
"I'll tell you the truth." 
"Now we're getting somewhere."
"I'll tell you what I know." 
"Now we're getting somewhere."
"I'll text him." 
"That's unnecessary. I've already told him."
"I'll walk home from here." 
"Are you sure?"
"I'll wash the dishes." 
"OK, I'll dry then."
"I'll win." 
"In your dreams."
"I'm Algerian." 
"Nigerian?" "Yes."
"I'm Bristol born and bred." 
"City or Rovers?" "City. City all the way."
"I'm Canadian." 
"No, you're not, Tom. You're from Boston."
"I'm Fadil, it's nice to meet you." 
"It's a pleasure to meet you, Fadil."
"I'm Jamal. Nice to meet you." 
"I'm Sarah."
"I'm Japanese," the boy answered.
"I'm Layla, the woman your husband is cheating on you with." 
"Leave us alone!"
"I'm Layla, your husband's mistress." 
"Don't call this number again!"
"I'm Sami's wife." 
"You mean ex-wife."
"I'm Tom." 
"I'm Mary. Nice to meet you."
"I'm Tom." 
"John. Nice to meet you "
"I'm Yanni, by the way." 
"Skura. Nice to meet you."
"I'm a Canadian just like you. I pay my taxes—" "I don't pay my taxes." 
"Oh."
"I'm a changed man." 
"Please!"
"I'm a ger." 
"What's a ger?" "A convert to Judaism."
"I'm a human being." 
"What's a human bean?"
"I'm a man's man!" "Oh, which man's man are you? Must be a lucky guy."
"I'm a narcissist." 
"No you're not."
"I'm a real boy!" shouted Pinocchio.
"I'm a skeptic." 
"What do you mean?" "I don't believe in supernatural things."
"I'm a trans lesbian." 
"No you're not. You're just a straight man appropriating homosexuality." 
"I'm dating another trans woman." 
"Oh, then you're just a fag." 
"Well, I'm glad you're so concerned about the appropriation of homosexuality." 
"Shut up, fag."
"I'm a woman." 
"And I'm a dinosaur!"
"I'm a woman." 
"How do you know that you're a woman?"
"I'm afraid I can't come." 
"That's a pity!"
"I'm afraid Tom's not at home." 
"But the light's on in his room!"
"I'm afraid of having eye surgery." 
"It's no time to be saying that kind of thing. At this rate, you might lose your eyesight."
"I'm afraid of having eye surgery." 
"It's no time to be saying that kind of thing. At this rate, you might lose your vision completely."
"I'm all alone." 
"But that's not true at all! You have friends!"
"I'm all alone." 
"But that's not true. You have friends!"
"I'm allergic to doing homework." 
"Stop being silly and go do it."
"I'm already married," replied Mary.
"I'm always being chased in my dream." 
"Who wants to catch you?" "I don't know, but when that something or someone catches me, I wake up."
"I'm an Egyptian man." 
"You can say that again."
"I'm an English learner." 
"But I thought you were a native English speaker." 
"I am. But I'll never be done learning."
"I'm an alpha male." 
"I don't care about your brodiac sign."
"I'm an idiot." 
"No, you're not."
"I'm an outgoing person," she added. "It's really frustrating to have to stay at home and not meet people."
"I'm ashamed to call you my son." 
"The feeling is mutual." 
"Oh yeah? Then get out of my house!"
"I'm back! I brought some takeout." 
"What'd you get?" "Some tonkotsu ramen." 
"Whoa, you know me so well! Well, let's eat already!"
"I'm back." 
"Welcome home."
"I'm better now. How did I survive 2011?" said Tom.
"I'm bored!" "Then find something to do! I'm not here to entertain you."
"I'm bored. If only I could watch telly!" "But you know Grandad hasn't got a telly."
"I'm busy, I'm busy" is all he ever says, so I never get to see him at all.
"I'm busy." 
"Busy doing what?"
"I'm certified as a spiritual healer." 
"Certified by who?" "Tom."
"I'm coming with you." 
"Dream on, bro."
"I'm coming with you." 
"You stay there!"
"I'm craving chicken parmesan tonight," said Matthew as he browsed the menu.
"I'm crying," said Anne in a tone of bewilderment. "I can't think why. I'm glad as glad can be."
"I'm dead." 
"No you're not."
"I'm divorcing Rima." 
"What?! Are you out of your mind?"
"I'm divorcing Skura." 
"You must be out of your mind, Yanni."
"I'm divorcing Skura." 
"You're literally out of your mind."
"I'm doing the best I can." 
"Oh, yeah? Do better."
"I'm dripping sweat." 
"Then make sure you take a shower!"
"I'm dying," says Pierrette.
"I'm filing for a divorce." 
"What? You can't do that!" "There is not a chance in hell that I'm coming back!"
"I'm fine." 
"No, you're not."
"I'm finished for the day." 
"Much appreciated."
"I'm flattered," Tom said sarcastically.
"I'm forgiving you." 
"I do'nt need your pity."
"I'm from Australia. Where are you from?" "I'm from New Zealand."
"I'm from Bejaia." 
"Where is Bejaia?" "It's in Algeria."
"I'm from Bejaia." 
"Wow! From Algeria!"
"I'm from Boston. Where are you from?" "I'm from Chicago."
"I'm from Canada," he said.
"I'm from the future, but I've been in the past for the last twenty years." 
"How do you keep track?" "There's an app."
"I'm gay." 
"I know, Tom." 
"How did you know?" "You're my boyfriend!"
"I'm getting hungry." 
"Me, too." 
"Do you want to eat?" "OK."
"I'm getting hungry." 
"Me, too." 
"Let's eat." 
"OK."
"I'm getting too old to be playing with bugs", said the boy.
"I'm glad I studied karate." 
"I'm glad you did, too."
"I'm glad to see you here," Tom said with a smile.
"I'm going back to school," she announced.
"I'm going for a smoke." 
"But you don't smoke." 
"Well, I'll start now, then, just to get out of here."
"I'm going for a walk!" "What do you mean, 'a walk'?! What about German?"
"I'm going for a walk. Then you can have a think about it in peace." 
"You do that, Tom."
"I'm going shopping. Do you want to come with me?" "Yes."
"I'm going shopping. Do you want to come?" "Sure!"
"I'm going this way." 
"In that case, I'm going that way. Farewell!"
"I'm going to AA so I have something to do other than drink." 
"OK, sounds good, but don't drink the Kool-Aid."
"I'm going to Boston tomorrow." 
"So am I."
"I'm going to Canada, but I'm worried my French isn't good enough." 
"Where are you going?" "Toronto." 
"You speak English. You'll be fine."
"I'm going to Hawaii next week." 
"Really?"
"I'm going to Nigeria." 
"You mean Algeria?"
"I'm going to Ottawa." 
"Go."
"I'm going to a funeral." 
"A funeral? Who died?"
"I'm going to a funeral." 
"I'm sorry."
"I'm going to a funeral." 
"Who died?"
"I'm going to bed." 
"Fine."
"I'm going to bed." 
"Good."
"I'm going to buy a new house. How about you?" "No, I'm not buying one."
"I'm going to college, Mom." 
"That's my boy."
"I'm going to count up slowly to three, Mary, and you'll wake up." 
"I'm already awake, Mister Kant."
"I'm going to divorce Skura." 
"Are you sick in the head?"
"I'm going to divorce Skura." 
"Sorry to hear that."
"I'm going to faint." 
"You're faking."
"I'm going to have a Japanese-style drink and sit-down today with some motsunabe." 
"A Japanese-style drink and sit-down? What's a Japanese-style drink and sit-down?" "It's when two people have a drink together." 
"Oh, got it. Have a good time."
"I'm going to have to get the recipe for this chicken parmesan," said Matthew's coworker at the office potluck.
"I'm going to make some coffee. Do you want any?" "Yes, thank you. Could you make mine with a little more milk?"
"I'm going to marry her." 
"It's not going to work out."
"I'm going to marry her." 
"You shouldn't do it."
"I'm going to marry her." 
"You shouldn't."
"I'm going to marry him." 
"You're not," said her father.
"I'm going to pull a rabbit out of the hat." 
"I'll pay to see that".
"I'm going to put a curse on you", said Mary.
"I'm going to ring up Hiromi." 
"She'll be asleep – it's the middle of the night in Japan." 
"Oh yeah. I'd completely forgotten that. I'll wait a few hours, then."
"I'm going to see your father today, about career counselling." 
"You don't need to bother with that."
"I'm going to sleep in 10 minutes." 
"You said that 10 minutes ago!"
"I'm going to sneak into the kitchen now and help myself to some of that pudding Mum made for the guests." 
"Don't you dare, Sonny Jim!" "Oh! Hello, Mum!"
"I'm going to the woods to pick some mushrooms." 
"Mind if I come?"
"I'm going to try to make chicken parmesan for my family tonight," said Matthew's sister after trying his recipe.
"I'm going, what do I need to bring?" "A good mood." 
"I'm not going."
"I'm gonna barf!" "Breathe deeply!"
"I'm gonna barf!" "Not inside the car, please!"
"I'm gonna go over there and see what's going on." 
"Don't."
"I'm gonna have a great time." 
"So will I."
"I'm gonna kick your ass!" "Look who's talking!"
"I'm gonna move in soon." 
"In your dreams."
"I'm gonna smash your face." 
"Really? Be my guest."
"I'm gonna take a nap." 
"Me too."
"I'm gonna tell her the truth." 
"You'll crush her."
"I'm gonna tell my..." 
"Dad? I know."
"I'm gutted." 
"So what's disappointed you so much?"
"I'm happy today!" "Why?" "Your grandpa died and he left your dad forty million dinars!" "My grandpa died and you're happy?"
"I'm hearing voices," said Tom. "Aren't we all?" replied the family cat.
"I'm hitting the road." 
"Where are you going?" "To Algiers."
"I'm hungry," said the small white rabbit, so they stopped and ate the flower from a large hyacinth.
"I'm hungry. Do we have anything?" "There's some cup noodles, would you want that?" "Yeah, I'll take it."
"I'm hungry. Tom, when's dinner ready?" "In a minute. You can lay the table. And don't forget the drinks."
"I'm hungry." 
"Hi Hungry; I'm Dad!"
"I'm hungry." 
"Hi, Hungry! I'm Dad!"
"I'm hungry." 
"Me too." 
"Will we have something to eat?" "Yes."
"I'm hungry." 
"So am I."
"I'm in Algiers." 
"Who cares?"
"I'm in a terrible hurry... for reasons I can't say," Dima replied to the woman. "Please, just let me try on that suit there."
"I'm in an Armani store buying a suit, of course," Dima replied.
"I'm in love with you." 
"Don't say that."
"I'm in shock because I think that I have lost one of my earphones." 
"You should have probably linked them together beforehand." 
"But then what's the point of them being wireless?"
"I'm innocent." 
"That's what they all say."
"I'm investigating the crimes". "Like Sherlock Holmes?" "Something like that".
"I'm invincible!" said Tom before dying.
"I'm jealous of your height." 
"Really? There's nothing good about being tall. You hit your head on the ceiling and all that."
"I'm jealous of your height." 
"Really? There's nothing good about being tall. You're always bumping your head on the ceiling."
"I'm just going out." 
"Stay here!"
"I'm just popping out on a date, OK?" "Come home by 7, Sakura!"
"I'm just thinking about my wish," replied the little black rabbit.
"I'm just your average Joe." 
"You mean Tom?" "What?"
"I'm kissing a potato. Now what?" said Tom, looking at Mary for direction.
"I'm learning Berber." 
"Why Berber?"
"I'm leaving tonight." 
"Don't give me that!"
"I'm leaving." 
"But you just got here."
"I'm leaving." 
"Have a good day."
"I'm leaving." 
"Not so fast, Ziri."
"I'm like any other woman." 
"That's where you're wrong."
"I'm literally tied up at the moment; can I call you later?" "That's a bit too much information, but sure!"
"I'm looking for a guy." 
"I'm a guy, aren't I?"
"I'm looking for a song name." 
"How does it go?" "It goes like da dada da da."
"I'm looking for my jacket." 
"Can you describe it? What color is it?"
"I'm looking for my..." 
"For your Berber dictionary?" "Yes." 
"It's here."
"I'm looking for the telephone number of the pizzeria on Rose Street. Will you help me find it?" — "So you're looking for the book service." — "You never really listen to me. I need the telephone number of the pizza delivery service." — "Are you talking about a pizza service?" — "That's just what I'm talking about." — "For me, then, a Hawaiian pizza."
"I'm made of honey." 
"Aww, you're sweet."
"I'm married. Is that a problem for you?" "No. I love cheaters."
"I'm moving to Boston next week." 
"I miss you already."
"I'm never going to be rich." 
"Not with that attitude."
"I'm not Tom," said Tom.
"I'm not a cop!" said Ziri insistently.
"I'm not a monster!", said Tom.
"I'm not a native English speaker so I can't teach you English, but can you teach me Japanese?" "Sure. I'd be happy to."
"I'm not a politician," said the politician.
"I'm not about to go prancing about in a disco." 
"Where to, then?" "I'm hungry."
"I'm not accustomed to working day and night." 
"You'll soon get used to it."
"I'm not afraid of Mary." 
"Well, you should be!"
"I'm not allowed to say that!" - "What would happen if you did so anyway?"
"I'm not an incel," Tom insisted. "I'm chaste."
"I'm not angry. Look, see this smiling face?" "That's what they call a forced smile!"
"I'm not as stubborn as Tom." 
"Not as stubborn? You're as stubborn as an old mule – far worse than Tom!" "I had no idea you thought that about me, Mary." 
"Everyone thinks that, John. Everyone!" "Well, you could knock me down with a feather."
"I'm not as stupid as people think." 
"Nobody thinks you're stupid."
"I'm not coming with you, Yanni." 
"Really? I'm gonna teach you a lesson, then." 
"Wait! What are you doing?" "Put the baby down!" "Let go of me! Help!" "I don't wanna harm the baby, so put him down!" "No! Help!"
"I'm not embarrassed." 
"Yes, you are."
"I'm not falling asleep," he said, opening his eyes and shaking his head.
"I'm not going to eat bugs." 
"Who said you had to?"
"I'm not going to let my sweet Fuyuhiko get married to a little girl who doesn't even have basic manners. Tell him that for me." 
"It's not so bad. I mean, she's cute." 
"No, she's not. And looks don't matter." 
"Well, don't get all worked up about it. You used to go to the disco every night and live it up, partying hard." 
"That's different." 
"It's the same thing! This is ridiculous. You need to learn to let things go."
"I'm not good at swimming." 
"Neither am I."
"I'm not good at this." 
"It just takes some practice."
"I'm not hungry anymore." 
"But you haven't eaten anything!"
"I'm not hungry, thank you." 
"I'll leave you some sandwiches in the kitchen, then."
"I'm not hungry." 
"Neither am I."
"I'm not hungry." 
"You're not hungry?"
"I'm not in love with Tom anymore." 
"Are you sure?"
"I'm not interrupting anything, am I?" "No, of course not."
"I'm not into girls, Rima." 
"Don't worry, I'm not into girls either. Ziri is my boyfriend."
"I'm not really sure if I should do it. What do you think?" "Hmm... You know what they say: sleep on it."
"I'm not sleeping. I'm always just skiving off." 
"That way's even worse!"
"I'm not sure to whom Tom's married." 
"Why, every newcomer to Tatoeba knows that: to Mary, of course!"
"I'm not sure what time is." 
"You mean what time it is?" "No, I mean, what's time? Who knows?"
"I'm not sure who Tom's married to." 
"But any Tatoeba newbie knows that: to Mary, of course!"
"I'm not talking about the lawyer Tom, it was the scientist Tom who got married with the farmer Mary." 
"How many Toms do you know?" "Boston is chock full of Toms. I've met 24 more in the last hour." 
"...You're pulling my leg."
"I'm not transphobic. I'm not afraid of trans people." 
"So all the fearmongering about us is just to scare other people into doing your bidding?"
"I'm not transphobic; I'm not afraid of trans people." 
"I'd say you are. You're afraid of us raping women in bathrooms, dominating women's sports, and brainwashing your children. And every single one of these fears is irrational, so the suffix -phobic couldn't possibly fit more."
"I'm not very good at this." 
"Neither am I."
"I'm not your big sister, Mary." 
"What are you on about?" "I'm your mum."
"I'm not your boyfriend. It was just a hookup." 
"What?"
"I'm not your dear." 
"But you will be."
"I'm not your girlfriend." 
"Yeah, and that's a shame."
"I'm now going dancing." 
"Oh, I'll come." 
"You're staying put to think about making up with Tom, because until you do, I want nothing to do with the pair of you."
"I'm now going on a fortnight's holiday." 
"Where are you off to?"
"I'm off to the country!" "Go!"
"I'm old enough to remember the fall of the Berlin wall", said Hans.
"I'm older than Ziri and I need to eat more." 
"Now, now. Your little baby brother, too, needs to eat well."
"I'm overheating like a dog," said Mary.
"I'm pregnant and it's yours." 
"What?!"
"I'm pregnant." 
"Pregnant? How did this happen?"
"I'm proud of you, Mom." 
"I'm proud of you, too."
"I'm proud to be an American." 
"Why would you be proud of something you had no choice over?"
"I'm quite nocturnal," said Mary. "What others do during the day, I do at night."
"I'm quitting." 
"What do you mean you're quitting?"
"I'm ready to tell the truth." 
"I need names."
"I'm really bad at art. Do you have any tips?" "Practice, practice, practice."
"I'm really bad at math. Do you have any tips?" "Practice, practice, practice."
"I'm really bad at this. Do you have any tips?" "Practice, practice, practice."
"I'm really excited. I have a little sweet tooth, so I saw pumpkin pies around, and I really want to try it," she said excitedly.
"I'm really from Firipin." 
"You mean Philippines, don't you?" "No, Firipin!"
"I'm really going to miss this house." 
"We're all going to miss it, Tom."
"I'm really sorry for..." 
"Save it and leave this house this instant!"
"I'm really thankful to you." 
"Once again?"
"I'm really tired. Could you just go and do the shopping for me today, Tom?" "Of course I can, Mary. You just sit down and rest."
"I'm shocked to hear that he died so soon after his infection was reported," a 21-year-old college student told NHK television.
"I'm sitting there." 
"And where am I sitting?" "Over there in the corner." 
"But I shan't see a thing from there."
"I'm sitting there." 
"And where am I sitting?" "Over there in the corner." 
"But I won't see a thing from there."
"I'm smarter than Plato. I know more about the world than he did." 
"But he helped get us where we are today."
"I'm so glad you got rid of him." 
"Me too."
"I'm so happy to see you." 
"I'm happy to see you too."
"I'm so horny I could fuck an octopus!" "Really?" "...No."
"I'm so lucky, what a blessing; but I'm just doing my own thing, oh my God!" says Alycia Nabeth in her famous song "Amxix-iw".
"I'm so scared!" "Don't wet your pants!"
"I'm so sorry." 
"Sorry? What for?" "Please forgive me." 
"There is nothing to forgive."
"I'm so ugly." 
"You're the opposite of ugly."
"I'm soaked to the skin." 
"So am I."
"I'm soaked with sweat." 
"Step back. You stink!"
"I'm sorry I hurt you." 
"Don't apologize. You didn't do anything wrong, Tom."
"I'm sorry I was late," he said shyly.
"I'm sorry about that." 
"Yeah, me too."
"I'm sorry about that." 
"Yeah, so am I."
"I'm sorry for coming to see you at such a late hour." 
"It's fine! I was kind of expecting your visit."
"I'm sorry for these circumstances" has ended up becoming quite a polite expression these days, hasn't it?
"I'm sorry for visiting at such a late hour." 
"It's fine! I somehow expected you to come."
"I'm sorry!" "It's OK. Don't worry."
"I'm sorry!" "It's nothing. Don't worry."
"I'm sorry, Tom." 
"Why are you apologizing?" "I was just thinking that I might be bothering you." 
"No, you aren't bothering me at all."
"I'm sorry, but your wife didn't make it." 
"Well, bring me the one my wife made."
"I'm sorry, sir." 
"Alright. But no repeats."
"I'm sorry," Dima apologized. "I just had the strangest feeling."
"I'm sorry,” was the first thing out of my mouth.
"I'm sorry. I can't do that anymore." 
"Can't do what anymore?"
"I'm sorry. I reflected on what I did." 
"Reflected on what you did? That's something that even a monkey could do!"
"I'm sorry. Your passport isn't here." 
"What!"
"I'm sorry." 
"Apology accepted."
"I'm sorry." 
"I bet you are sorry."
"I'm sorry." 
"I'm sorry, too."
"I'm sorry." 
"It's OK. No damage done."
"I'm sorry." 
"No, you're not."
"I'm sorry." 
"Sorry? For what?"
"I'm sorry." 
"You think you can get away with it just by saying sorry!?"
"I'm sotally tober," Tom insisted.
"I'm speechless!" "So was I when I heard it!"
"I'm spending the evening with Tom." 
"Isn't Tom your cat?"
"I'm standing in front of the church. Where are you?" "Outside the town hall."
"I'm starving." 
"It's coming."
"I'm starving." 
"There are some leftovers in the fridge."
"I'm staying with a family — they're also from Brazil, but they've been living here for a really long time," said Rebeca Oliveira Esteves, a student at American University originally from Brazil.
"I'm studying Japanese." 
"Really? Cool!"
"I'm surprised Tom doesn't take that dictionary to bed with him at night, he seems to love it so much." 
"I saw it lying next to his pillow the other day."
"I'm surprised the rain lasts this long here." 
"It's an unusual storm."
"I'm surrounded by cats!" "Sounds like a nice problem to have."
"I'm taking all the money." 
"Oh yeah? We'll see about that."
"I'm taking the whole day off today." 
"Really? The whole day?"
"I'm telling you right now: I'm terrible when angry," said Tom quietly but convincingly. "I don't advise anyone to test my patience."
"I'm the happiest man in the world," Tom said to himself.
"I'm the witch of the sand." 
"The sand witch?"
"I'm thirsty!" complained Mary. Tom stood up and left the room without saying a word. A little while later he returned with a bottle of grape juice and a glass, setting them down on the table in front of her.
"I'm tired of watching TV. Let's do something else." 
"Like what?"
"I'm tired." 
"I'm the one who should be tired."
"I'm tired." 
"Tell someone who cares, Tom."
"I'm too old to be playing with bugs," said the boy.
"I'm too old to play with bugs," said the boy.
"I'm trying to get pregnant." 
"Good luck!"
"I'm trying" won't be enough, I think.
"I'm ugly." 
"No you're not."
"I'm ugly." 
"Oh, yeah, you're SO ugly."
"I'm undercooked," said the food.
"I'm very gay." 
"I didn't know there were degrees..."
"I'm very surprised how long he dares to stay there, with such a great plague in that city." 
"It is not so surprising."
"I'm wondering whether I should buy a steam iron, what do you think? Or should I say, buy me one!" "No. Buy one yourself."
"I'm working as a nursing assistant now." 
"What does that entail?" "I move patients so that they don't get bedsore, change their diapers, and help them use the bathroom and eat too." 
"Do you find it enjoyable?" "I don't know about enjoyable, but I think it's an important job." 
"Ah, gotcha, well keep it up!"
"I'm worried. I'm lucky to have some savings, and I know a lot of people don't," Brooks says.
"I'm your best customer!" said Tom. "No, you're our worst," replied Mary.
"I'm your friend." 
"You're my boss now, not my friend."
"I'm your mother." 
"Stepmother."
"I'm yours tonight." 
"Sorry. I don't sleep with bitches."
"I'm yours tonight." 
"What do you mean?"
"I'm... your father." 
"And I'm... speechless."
"I've a touch of a cold." 
"That's too bad."
"I've already corrected the sentence three times!" "But it still contains mistakes."
"I've been busy." 
"Busy doing what?"
"I've been chosen to receive a commendation at the graduation ceremony. I'm about to go to rehearsal for it now." 
"Amazing! See you! Hope you don't trip on stage."
"I've been considering a new career." 
"Really? What?" "Teaching Berber."
"I've been fired again." 
"Again?"
"I've been fired." 
"You've got to be kidding me."
"I've been given the boot." 
"Seriously?"
"I've been invited to dinner with friends on Friday, but I've got time on Saturday." 
"Great. How about 3 p.m.?" "All right."
"I've been sacked." 
"Seriously?"
"I've been studying this week’s lesson for hours, but I'm not sure if I know this or not." 
"Suppose I show you the flash cards. That way we can see if you’ve mastered your vocabulary."
"I've bought Yanni some pizza." 
"But Yanni hates pizza."
"I've brought Mei up by my own hand. You think I'd give her up so easily to some stranger from who knows where? If you want to marry her, bring me a statement of your qualifications." 
"Of course. I've brought it with me." 
"Give it to me. Huh. Academic background: Tatoeba Medical School, graduate. Place of work: Tatoeba General Hospital. Position: Assistant Professor." 
"Well then, come on in. Hey, bring some sake! On the double!"
"I've come to see Jamal." 
"Come in."
"I've converted to Islam." 
"I know."
"I've decided to buy a new car." 
"Now you're talking."
"I've decided to divorce Skura." 
"Are you out of your mind?"
"I've decided to divorce Skura." 
"You must have lost your mind, Yanni."
"I've decided to divorce Skura." 
"You're literally out of your mind, Yanni." 
"Let me explain, Dad." 
"I don't want to hear anything about it."
"I've decided to divorce your mother." 
"Why?" "I'm sorry to put it this way, son, but your mother is nothing but a cheating whore."
"I've decided to quit." 
"You're the best mechanic I've got."
"I've decided to sell the house." 
"Where are we going to live?"
"I've finally learnt. I can finally ride a bike!" "Late, but better late than never, eh? Let's see then, Tom! Hop on and ride it a bit!"
"I've finally learnt. I can finally ride a bike!" "Late, but better late than never, eh? Let's see then, Tom! Hop on the saddle and take it for a spin!"
"I've finished" said Tony shortly, then he closed the piano.
"I've found a way to make him really jealous." 
"Oh, do tell!"
"I've got a bit of interest in learning French, but isn't it hard?" "Not at all. It's 100 times easier than English!" "Really?" "Well, at least to me it is." 
"That's because you're native, though."
"I've got a lot of friends." 
"That's because you're a drug dealer."
"I've got about three times as many books as Tom." 
"But Tom's read all his books at least twice. Can you say the same?" "Oh, I haven't got time for reading."
"I've got good and bad news." 
"The bad first." 
"Are you sure you don't want to hear the good news first?"
"I've got mono." 
"Did you kiss someone?"
"I've got no idea about art." 
"Me neither."
"I've got some big news." 
"My wife is dead?"
"I've got something to tell you, Skura." 
"Yes?" "Yanni has a wife back in Algeria."
"I've got something to tell you." 
"Yes?" "Yanni is with another woman."
"I've got something to tell you." 
"Yes?" "Yanni remarried and has four children."
"I've got to get better," Sadako thought to herself.
"I've got two bits of news: one bad and one—" "Good?" "—and one very bad. Where should I start?"
"I've heard Tom is on his deathbed." 
"Deathbed? He's never been better!"
"I've heard about it, Koichi." 
"You don't need to say anything more, I know. It's the summer festival incident at the shrine, right?"
"I've heard from some people that when they got COVID, they had brain fog for months." 
"In that case, I've had COVID all my life."
"I've heard of your methods before now, Mr. Holmes," said he, tartly. "You are ready enough to use all the information that the police can lay at your disposal, and then you try to finish the case yourself and bring discredit on them."
"I've heard soy sauce goes well with vanilla ice cream." 
"For real?"
"I've just come out of jail and I want to go see Mom." 
"Mom?" "Yeah." 
"Fuck you, dude! Mom died four months ago." 
"No shit!" "You haven't even heard about that." 
"It's all your fault! You never wrote. You never visited. How could I have known about that?" "You know what? Just fuck off and never call me again. You and I no longer have anything in common. You're on your own now. Just leave me alone."
"I've just had a few drinks." 
"A few drinks? What a joke! You're as drunk as a skunk!"
"I've just saved you from Ganon!" "You did not." 
"Okay then."
"I've just spoken to Tom." 
"What about?" "About what Mary did."
"I've lost my wallet," John sighed.
"I've made some nyumen as a midnight snack. Do you want some?" "Yes, I do!"
"I've missed you." 
"I've missed you, too."
"I've never been this sick, ever," said Carlos.
"I've never been this sick, ever," said Tom.
"I've never done this before." 
"Me neither."
"I've never met a member of that group who wasn't a terrible person." 
"How would you know? Maybe you met some who were good people, but they just didn't tell you they were part of the group."
"I've never really been happy," Tom admitted. As if on cue, somewhere in the background a baby started to cry.
"I've never really been happy," Tom admitted. Fittingly, a baby began to cry somewhere in the background.
"I've never seen that word before. Are you sure it's French?" "Oh, that's just Tom's idiolect. He likes to come up with his own way of saying things, usually based on his experience with other languages."
"I've never seen you wearing a hat. Do you ever wear a hat?" "No, not really."
"I've never thought about this," said the man. "What should we do?"
"I've not had dinner. Would you care to join me?" "I'd love to."
"I've only got a small brown loaf, I'm afraid, or large white. The Russian ryebread is nice." 
"No, my wife says it gets in her teeth, and the kids just leave the crusts everywhere."
"I've only had two boyfriends." 
"Oh, I have two boyfriends right now."
"I've only talked to Mary." 
"You're not to even see her again. Understood?" "Don't you think this jealousy is a bit much, Tom?"
"I've read their books." 
"Whose books?" "The Strugatsky brothers'."
"I've seen a lot of things in my time here," he said to her, "but I've never seen that."
"I've seen that play." 
"So have I."
"I've seen that tactic used a lot by BOFA." 
"What's BOFA?" "Bofa deez nuts."
"I've spilt my juice." 
"Run into the kitchen and grab a cloth."
"I've still got to translate a business letter into English. Will you help me?" "That's not the sort of thing I find easy, but I'll try."
"I've stopped smoking." 
"When?" "Two days ago."

"It's 11 o'clock. Get up! Now!" "Go away and let me sleep in peace! I didn't get home till half six."
"It's Dima!" Dima exclaimed. "Is your caller ID not working or something?"
"It's Robert!" "What the fudge!"
"It's Tom's birthday today!" "No! Is it? Well, we'll have to get something for him!"
"It's Ziri." 
"Tell him I'm not here."
"It's Ziri." 
"Who else would it be?"
"It's a bird!" "It's a plane!" "It's Superman!"
"It's a bit late." 
"Not late for me."
"It's a cannon shot, is it not?" I nodded.
"It's a genuine Gucci." 
"Please!"
"It's a good time for you to take a vacation," the boss said to Jim.
"It's a great evening, don't you think?" "It is, but it's so hot!"
"It's a great plan." 
"Says you."
"It's a lie!" he shouted, "an infernal lie!"
"It's a long story." 
"Yeah, a long and boring story."
"It's a mink," said Tom, causing bewilderment among his friends.
"It's a miracle! It moved!" "I think it's the wind."
"It's a nice Kabyle dress." 
"Thanks. Salas gave it to me."
"It's a pity that we'll die in some days and we won't see our children growing up. They'll surely be clever and cute", said the mother cockchafer.
"It's a pleasure to meet you." 
"Likewise."
"It's a poor sort of memory that only works backwards," the Queen remarked.
"It's a pretty good world, after all, isn't it, Marilla?" concluded Anne happily.
"It's a problem." 
"It's no problem."
"It's a very delicate thing," said he. "One does not like to speak of one's domestic affairs to strangers. It seems dreadful to discuss the conduct of one's wife with two men whom I have never seen before."
"It's a woman as wants to see you;" the boy answered, pointing towards the shop.
"It's all in here," said Tom pointing to his head.
"It's all over." 
"But only for the moment."
"It's all right," I said.
"It's all your fault, Tom." 
"What?" "Nothing; I'm just messing with you."
"It's almost five." 
"What happens at five?" "You'll have to wait and see."
"It's almost — I would not say a positive thing, but it's really helping in taming the more dangerous variants," Ravel said.
"It's alright for you to go to bed if you're feeling tired." 
"I'm not tired." 
"Despite doing nothing but yawn this whole time? If you're tired you should really go to bed and not overdo yourself." 
"Do you want me to sleep that badly?"
"It's an atmosphere like a ghost might appear" "Hey, don't say such stupid things!" "Wait, Tom, are you afraid of ghosts?"
"It's beautiful here," he said, "but I'm so tired I can hardly keep my eyes open. I'm going to get some sleep."
"It's because you're a girl." 
"That's sexist."
"It's been a while since I last saw your smile, Tom. Recently you've been looking gloomy all the time, so I was worried about you." 
"Really? Sorry for making you worry."
"It's been a while since I've seen milk in a bottle." 
"Me too. I somehow feel its nicer than milk in a paper carton, don't you?" "I was thinking the same thing."
"It's been a while since we had a serious conversation, eh." 
"That's for sure. We usually only have idiotic conversations."
"It's best if you don't smoke. Have some chewing gum!" he said amicably, slipping three pieces into his waistcoat pocket.
"It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." 
"Then why are you still alive?"
"It's brass monkeys in here! Shut the window and put the heating on, will you?" "Put a jacket on!"

"It's called X now." 
"By Elon Musk, and nobody else."
"It's childish to play with a teddy bear. I'd rather look at the news." 
"But Tom, you're only six. You can be quietly childish. Just be that and enjoy it!"
"It's cold! I hate it!" Yoshiki complains with teary face.
"It's cold, isn't it? With it being this cold, you'd want to go into hibernation, wouldn't you?" "Eh, the colder weather excites me. I'd rather sleep through the summer."
"It's complicated," said Christina Simkanin, a biologist at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, "which isn't a super-satisfying answer if you want a direct, should we keep it or should we not? But it's the reality."
"It's complicated," said Mary.
"It's complicated," said Tom.
"It's difficult for me to say the shahada in Arabic." 
"Say it in English."
"It's fine," Dima laughed. "I'm still growing, after all. I'll grow into it."
"It's for you." 
"Who's that?"
"It's free." 
"Libre or gratis?"
"It's fresh, it's pretty tasty, and the price is really good!" she said.
"It's gonna be expensive." 
"Meaning?" "Meaning that I'm not gonna take part in that."
"It's good for girls to play sports." 
"Is that so? I prefer quiet children."
"It's good to see you." 
"It's good to see you, too."
"It's got really cold again, hasn't it?" "Yeah, and yet it was so warm yesterday."
"It's high time you took a vacation," Jim's boss said to him.
"It's hot today." 
"Sure is."
"It's hot." 
"This is a typical Algerian summer."
"It's interesting, though, innit?" "Yeah, it is. Look, I've got to be off now. See you later." 
"Yeah. Bye, mate."
"It's just a big circle, you get high, you get tricked, you get the money and you just keep going around and going around, and you have to break off all of them to even be doing okay." Breaking Free The women at Breaking Free support each other while they discuss the difficulty of leaving sex work It is an uphill battle. "I just need the support and to believe in myself that I can make it. It's a funny spot I'm in."

"It's just frustrating to know that very high-speed internet exists right down the road at a public school, and it can't find its way here," he says.
"It's just like 1984!" "Is it really, though?"
"It's just not working. What do I do now?" "Stick at it!"
"It's mind-blowing," said Tom.
"It's mind-blowing," says WWF Director-General Marco Lambertini, describing the crisis as "unprecedented in its speed, in its scale, and because it is single-handed."
"It's nearly ten o'clock, and Steve's still asleep. Isn't he going to get up?" "You'll have to wait until this afternoon. He didn't get home until the early hours." 
"By then, it'll be almost dark again!" "That's just how it is with Steve."
"It's nice that you exist." 
"Yeah, I find that nice, too."
"It's nice to hear your voice."

"What's the difference?"
"It's not a secret," she cried. "Do you suppose that the whole street—the whole of London, for that matter—— Get away, Austin, we don't want you here. Do you suppose they don't all talk about you?"
"It's not about abusing trans kids; it's about parents' rights." 
"Parents' rights to do what?"

"It's not my baby." 
"Oh yes, it is."
"It's not my fault if you lose things." 
"But you stole them from me!"
"It's not my job" is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
"It's not out of laziness or disinterest that we do not work faster." 
"But?"
"It's not working." 
"How about now?"
"It's nothing." 
"It's not nothing."
"It's okay. I won't bite", said the vampire.

"It's tough being a mom." 
"Ask me."

"It’s a woman as wants to see you;" the boy answered, pointing towards the shop.

"I’m Japanese," the boy answered.
"I’m back." 
"Welcome home."
"I’m finished for the day." 
"Much appreciated."

"I’m going to Hawaii next week." 
"Really?"
"I’m going to see your father today, about career counselling." 
"You don’t need to bother with that."
"I’m hungry," said the small white rabbit, so they stopped and ate the flower from a large hyacinth.
"I’m in a terrible hurry... for reasons I can’t say," Dima replied to the woman. "Please, just let me try on that suit there."
"I’m in an Armani store buying a suit, of course," Dima replied.
"I’m just popping out on a date, OK?" "Come home by 7, Sakura!"
"I’m just thinking about my wish," replied the little black rabbit.

"That’s too bad."
"I’ve finished" said Tony shortly, then he closed the piano.

"I’ve seen that play." 
"So have I."
"Jack's moving out in January. He promised." 
"Jack's promises don't mean anything."
"Jack, I have my own kind of meditation—Study Meditation." 
"Describe it to me, Sam." 
"Okay, you walk, sit, or lie quietly, while you study a language—sentence constructions and vocabulary—all in your head."
"Jack, I like meditating in water, like sitting in a jacuzzi or wading in a pool." 
"It sounds great, Sam."
"Jack, I'll give you an example of Imaginary Visualization: The plants in the garden have blue leaves. The courtyard is square with white marble benches at the sides. There is some dawn light. It is quiet. I sit on a bench." 
"Wow, Sam, you have good imagination!"
"Jack, at the Thai temple, we meditators use a big empty hall with a hardwood floor. At night, we use candlelight." 
"What a romantic setting, Sam!"
"Jack, if you would be mindful about everything you do, like eating, walking, sitting, etc., you could be meditating most of the time." 
"Sam, it sounds like a good idea."
"Jack, whenever there is no good video to watch, no good movie to see in the theatre, or no good book or magazine to read, I opt for Imaginary Visualization. I invent a setting in my mind and stay there for a while." 
"Sam, can you give me an example?" "It might be a calming teahouse in orbit around a roving gas giant planet, or something totally different."
"Jack, you can meditate for at least five minutes daily, if you're pressed for time." 
"Okay, Sam." 
"Myself, I try for about 15 to 30 minutes a day."
"Jack, you can meditate sitting in a posture or walking, maybe to and fro." 
"Oh, Sam, you're a keener!"

"Macau-Macau!" exclaimed Michael, the Guǎngzhōu Man, when we were thinking about Tagalog and the Philippines, as we were sitting at Lulu Island's Tim Hortons café, after 10:00, June 15, 2025. "Malaki?" I wondered if he was referring to the word for "big." I asserted: "'Lalaki' is for a man or boy, a male. 'Babae' is for a woman or girl, a female." It was déjà vu: I remembered that conversation with him from years ago. I was explaining that Tagalog words for gender alluded to size or stature. To Michael, the Philippines seems like a big Macau, the Portuguese ex-colony in the PRC, except that the Philippines is ex-Spanish. After we talked more about other subjects, Michael had to leave to pick up his kids at Sunday ESL class at posh Aberdeen Centre. At the café, Alex, my Filipino friend, reminded me about Mass times: Well before 15:00, I ventured walking in the blue-sky sunshine to the "Clam Temple," the Roman Catholic church on St. Albans Road. In the great worship hall, there were just a Filipina nun in her nun outfit and two women church co-workers at the front. I was sitting way back. Feeling the void was all that was necessary, except that one of the ladies started using a handheld vacuum cleaner to clean underneath the votive candle stands, where some candles were lit. I exited to the nice sunshine, as I sat on a bench. I'm Buddhoanimist as many Asians. The "Clam Temple" is a good ersatz for me. It was likely my 44th visit this year for me there. Ah, the void...
