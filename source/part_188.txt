Why does math seem to come easily to some folks and baffle others? Studies at Cornell University have shown that some people would rather write a long essay, for instance, than be put on the spot to come up with the correct answer to a math problem.

Children who've done it and come up with wrong answers often enough can develop a lifetime phobia for math.
